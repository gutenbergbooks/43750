<h2>FOREWORD</h2>

<p>In his Presidential Address to the Royal Anthropological
Institute this year the late Dr.
Rivers put his finger upon the most urgent need
for reform in the study of Man, when he appealed
for "the Unity of Anthropology". No true conception
of the nature and the early history of the
human family can be acquired by investigations,
however carefully they may be done, of one class
of evidence only. The physical characters of a
series of skulls can give no reliable information
unless their exact provenance and relative age are
known. But the interpretation of the meaning of
these characters cannot be made unless we know
something of the movements of the people and the
distinctive peculiarities of the inhabitants of the
foreign lands from which they may have come.
No less important than the study of their physical
structure is the cultural history of peoples. The
real spirit of a population is revealed by its
social and industrial achievements, and by its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
customs and beliefs, rather than by the shape of
the heads and members of its units. The revival
of the belief in the widespread diffusion of culture
in early times has, as one of its many important
effects, directed attention to the physical peculiarities
of the mixed populations of important foci of
civilization throughout the world. Such inquiries
have not only enabled the student of human
structure to detect racial affinities where he might
otherwise have neglected to look for them, but on
the other hand they have been able to give the
investigator of cultural diffusion evidence of the
most definite and irrefutable kind in corroboration
of the reality of his inferences.</p>

<p>At the present time students are just awakening
to the fact that no adequate idea of the anthropology
of any area can be acquired unless every
kind of evidence, somatic and cultural, be taken
into account, and the problems of the particular
locality are integrated with those worldwide movements
of men and of civilization of which the
people and culture of that locality form a part.</p>

<p>The great merit of Mr. Donald Mackenzie's
book is due in the main to the fact that he has
taken this wider vision of his subject and interpreted
the history of early man in Britain, not
simply by describing the varieties of head-form
or of implements, customs and beliefs, but rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">vii</a></span>
by indicating how these different categories of
information can be put into their appropriate
setting in the history of mankind as a whole.
There is nothing of technical pedantry about Mr.
Mackenzie's writing. He has made himself
thoroughly familiar with the customs and beliefs
of the whole world, as his remarkable series of
books on mythology has revealed, and in the
process of acquiring this mass of information he
has not sacrificed his common sense and powers
of judgment. He has been able to see clearly
through this amazing jumble of confusing statements
the way in which every phase of civilization
in all parts of the world is closely correlated with
the rest; and he has given luminous expression
to this clear vision of the history of man and
civilization as it affects Britain.</p>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>This volume deals with the history of man in Britain
from the Ice Age till the Roman period. The evidence
is gleaned from the various sciences which are usually
studied apart, including geology, archæology, philology,
ethnology or anthropology, &amp;c., and the writer has set
himself to tell the story of Ancient Man in a manner
which will interest a wider circle of readers than is usually
reached by purely technical books. It has not been
assumed that the representatives of Modern Man who
first settled in Europe were simple-minded savages.
The evidence afforded by the craftsmanship, the burial
customs, and the art of the Crô-Magnon races, those
contemporaries of the reindeer and the hairy mammoth in
South-western France, suggests that they had been influenced
by a centre of civilization in which considerable
progress had already been achieved. There is absolutely
no evidence that the pioneers were lacking in intelligence
or foresight. If we are to judge merely by
their skeletons and the shapes and sizes of their skulls,
it would appear that they were, if anything, both physically
and mentally superior to the average present-day
inhabitants of Europe. Nor were they entirely isolated
from the ancient culture area by which they had been
originally influenced. As is shown, the evidence
afforded by an Indian Ocean sea-shell, found in a Crô-Magnon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
burial cavern near Mentone, indicates that
much has yet to be discovered regarding the activities
of the early people.</p>

<p>In writing the history of Ancient Man in Britain, it
has been found necessary to investigate the Continental
evidence. When our early ancestors came from somewhere,
they brought something with them, including
habits of life and habits of thought. The story unfolded
by British finds is but a part of a larger story; and if
this larger story is to be reconstructed, our investigations
must extend even beyond the continent of Europe. The
data afforded by the "Red Man of Paviland", who
was buried with Crô-Magnon rites in a Welsh cave,
not only emphasize that Continental and North African
cultural influences reached Britain when the ice-cap was
retreating in Northern Europe, but that from its very
beginnings the history of our civilization cannot be
considered apart from that of the early civilization of the
world as a whole. The writer, however, has not assumed
in this connection that in all parts of the world man had of
necessity to pass through the same series of evolutionary
stages of progress, and that the beliefs, customs, crafts,
arts, &amp;c., of like character found in different parts of the
world were everywhere of spontaneous generation.
There were inventors and discoverers and explorers in
ancient times as there are at present, and many new
contrivances were passed on from people to people.
The man who, for instance, first discovered how to
"make fire" by friction of fire-sticks was undoubtedly
a great scientist and a benefactor of his kind. It is
shown that shipbuilding had a definite area of origin.</p>

<p>The "Red Man of Paviland" also reveals to us minds
pre-occupied with the problems of life and death. It is
evident that the corpse of the early explorer was smeared
with red earth and decorated with charms for very
definite reasons. That the people who thus interred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>
their dead with ceremony were less intelligent than the
Ancient Egyptians who adopted the custom of mummification,
or the Homeric heroes who practised cremation,
we have no justification for assuming.</p>

<p>At the very dawn of British history, which begins
when the earliest representatives of Modern Man reached
our native land, the influences of cultures which had
origin in distant areas of human activity came drifting
northward to leave an impress which does not appear to
be yet wholly obliterated. We are the heirs of the Ages
in a profounder sense than has hitherto been supposed.</p>

<p>Considered from this point of view, the orthodox
scheme of Archæological Ages, which is of comparatively
recent origin, leaves much to be desired. If anthropological
data have insisted upon one thing more than
another, it is that modes of thought, which govern
action, were less affected by a change of material from
which artifacts (articles made by man) were manufactured
than they were by religious ideas and by new means for
obtaining the necessary food supply. A profounder
change was effected in the habits of early man in
Britain by the introduction of the agricultural mode of
life, and the beliefs, social customs, &amp;c., connected with
it, than could possibly have been effected by the introduction
of edged implements of stone, bone, or metal.</p>

<p>As a substitute for the Archæological Ages, the writer
suggests in this volume a new system, based on habits
of life, which may be found useful for historical purposes.
In this system the terms "Palæolithic", "Neolithic",
&amp;c., are confined to industries. "Neolithic
man", "Bronze Age man", "Iron Age man", and other
terms of like character may be favoured by some
archæologists, but they mean little or nothing to most
anatomists, who detect different racial types in a single
"Age". A history of ancient man cannot ignore one
set of scientists to pleasure another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">xii</a></span>
Several chapters are devoted to the religious beliefs
and customs of our ancestors, and it is shown that there
is available for study in this connection a mass of
evidence which the archæological agnostics are too prone
to ignore. The problem of the megalithic monuments
must evidently be reconsidered in the light of the fuller
anthropological data now available. Indeed, it would
appear that a firmer basis than that afforded by "crude
evolutionary ideas" must be found for British archæology
as a whole. The evidence of surviving beliefs and
customs, of Celtic philology and literature, of early Christian
writings, and of recent discoveries in Spain, Mesopotamia,
and Egypt, cannot, to say the least of it, be
wholly ignored.</p>

<p>In dealing with the race problem, the writer has sifted
the available data which throw light on its connection
with the history of British culture, and has written as he
has written in the hope that the growth of fuller knowledge
on the subject will be accompanied by the growth
of a deeper sympathy and a deeper sense of kinship than
has hitherto prevailed in these islands of ours, which were
colonized from time to time by groups of enterprising
pioneers, who have left an enduring impress on the
national character. The time is past for beginning a
history of Britain with the Roman invasion, and for the
too-oft-repeated assertion that before the Romans
reached Britain our ancestors were isolated and half
civilized.</p>

<p class="title1">ANCIENT MAN IN<br />
BRITAIN</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
<small>Britons of the Stone Age</small></h2>

<p class="blockquote">Caricatures of Early Britons&mdash;Enterprising Pioneers&mdash;Diseases and
Folk-cures&mdash;Ancient Surgical Operations&mdash;Expert Artisans&mdash;Organized
Communities&mdash;Introduction of Agriculture&mdash;Houses and Cooking Utensils&mdash;Spinning
and Weaving&mdash;Different Habits of Life&mdash;The Seafarers.</p>

<p>The Early Britons of the Stone Age have suffered
much at the hands of modern artists, and especially the
humorous artists. They are invariably depicted as rude
and irresponsible savages, with semi-negroid features,
who had perforce to endure our rigorous and uncertain
climate clad in loosely fitting skin garments, and to go
about, even in the depth of winter, barefooted and bareheaded,
their long tangled locks floating in the wind.</p>

<p>As a rule, the artists are found to have confused ideas
regarding the geological periods. Some place the white
savages in the age when the wonderful megalithic
monuments were erected and civilization was well advanced,
while others consign them to the far-distant
Cretaceous Age in association with the monstrous reptiles
that browsed on tropical vegetation, being unaware,
apparently, that the reptiles in question ceased to exist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
before the appearance of the earliest mammals. Not
unfrequently the geological ages and the early stages of
human culture are hopelessly mixed up, and monsters
that had been extinct for several million years are shown
crawling across circles that were erected by men possessed
of considerable engineering skill.</p>

<p>It is extremely doubtful if our remote ancestors of the
Stone Age were as savage or as backward as is generally
supposed. They were, to begin with, the colonists
who made Britain a land fit for a strenuous people to
live in. We cannot deny them either courage or enterprise,
nor are we justified in assuming that they were
devoid of the knowledge and experience required to
enable them to face the problems of existence in their
new environment. They came from somewhere, and
brought something with them; their modes of life did
not have origin in our native land.</p>

<p>Although the early people lived an open-air life, it is
doubtful if they were more physically fit than are the
Britons of the twentieth century. They were certainly
not immune from the ravages of disease. In their
graves are found skeletons of babies, youths, and
maidens, as well as those of elderly men and women;
some spines reveal unmistakable evidence of the effects
of rheumatism, and worn-down teeth are not uncommon.
It is possible that the diseases associated with marshy
localities and damp and cold weather were fairly prevalent,
and that there were occasional pestilences with
heavy death-rates. Epidemics of influenza and measles
may have cleared some areas for periods of their inhabitants,
the survivors taking flight, as did many Britons
of the fifth century of our own era, when the country
was swept by what is referred to in a Welsh book<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> as
"the yellow plague", because "it made yellow and
bloodless all whom it attacked". At the same time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
recognition must be given to the fact that the early
people were not wholly ignorant of medical science.
There is evidence that some quite effective "folk cures"
are of great antiquity&mdash;that the "medicine-men" and
sorcerers of Ancient Britain had discovered how to treat
certain diseases by prescribing decoctions in which herbs
and berries utilized in modern medical science were
important ingredients. More direct evidence is available
regarding surgical knowledge and skill. On the
Continent and in England have been found skulls on
which the operation known as trepanning&mdash;the removing
of a circular piece of skull so as to relieve the brain from
pressure or irritation&mdash;was successfully performed, as
is shown by the fact that severed bones had healed
during life. The accomplished primitive surgeons had
used flint instruments, which were less liable than those
of metal to carry infection into a wound. One cannot
help expressing astonishment that such an operation
should have been possible&mdash;that an ancient man who
had sustained a skull injury in a battle, or by accident,
should have been again restored to sanity and health.
Sprains and ordinary fractures were doubtless treated
with like skill and success. In some of the incantations
and charms collected by folk-lorists are lines which
suggest that the early medicine-men were more than
mere magicians. One, for instance, dealing with the
treatment of a fracture, states:</p>

<p class="blockquote">"He put marrow to marrow; he put pith to pith; he put
bone to bone; he put membrane to membrane; he put tendon
to tendon; he put blood to blood; he put tallow to tallow;
he put flesh to flesh; he put fat to fat; he put skin to skin;
he put hair to hair; he put warm to warm; he put cool to
cool."</p>

<p>"This," comments a medical man, "is quite a wonderful
statement of the aim of modern surgical 'co-aptation',
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
and we can hardly believe such an exact form of words
imaginable without a very clear comprehension of the
natural necessity of correct and precise setting."<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The discovery that Stone Age man was capable of
becoming a skilled surgeon is sufficient in itself to make
us revise our superficial notions regarding him. A new
interest is certainly imparted to our examination of his
flint instruments. Apparently these served him in good
stead, and it must be acknowledged that, after all, a
stone tool may, for some purposes, be quite as adequate
as one of metal. It certainly does not follow that the
man who uses a sharper instrument than did the early
Briton is necessarily endowed with a sharper intellect,
or that his ability as an individual artisan is greater.
The Stone Age man displayed wonderful skill in chipping
flint&mdash;a most difficult operation&mdash;and he shaped
and polished stone axes with so marked a degree of
mathematical precision that, when laid on one side, they
can be spun round on a centre of gravity. His saws
were small, but are still found to be quite serviceable for
the purposes they were constructed for, such as the
cutting of arrow shafts and bows, and the teeth are so
minute and regular that it is necessary for us to use a
magnifying glass in order to appreciate the workmanship.
Some flint artifacts are comparable with the products of
modern opticians. The flint workers must have had
wonderfully keen and accurate eyesight to have produced,
for instance, little "saws" with twenty-seven teeth to the
inch, found even in the north of Scotland. In Ancient
Egypt these "saws" were used as sickles.</p>

<p>Considerable groups of the Stone Age men of Britain
had achieved a remarkable degree of progress. They
lived in organized communities, and had evidently codes
of laws and regularized habits of life. They were not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
entirely dependent for their food supply on the fish they
caught and the animals they slew and snared. Patches
of ground were tilled, and root and cereal crops cultivated
with success. Corn was ground in handmills;<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
the women baked cakes of barley and wheat and rye.
A rough but serviceable pottery was manufactured and
used for cooking food, for storing grain, nuts, and
berries, and for carrying water. Houses were constructed
of wattles interwoven between wooden beams
and plastered over with clay, and of turf and stones;
these were no doubt thatched with heather, straw, or
reeds. Only a small proportion of the inhabitants of
Ancient Britain could have dwelt in caves, for the simple
reason that caves were not numerous. Underground
dwellings, not unlike the "dug-outs" made during the
recent war, were constructed as stores for food and as
winter retreats.</p>

<p>As flax was cultivated, there can be little doubt that
comfortable under-garments were worn, if not by all, at
any rate by some of the Stone Age people. Wool was
also utilized, and fragments of cloth have been found on
certain prehistoric sites, as well as spindle-whorls of
stone, bone, and clay, wooden spindles shaped so as to
serve their purpose without the aid of whorls, bone
needles, and crochet or knitting-pins. Those who have
assumed that the Early Britons were attired in skin
garments alone, overlook the possibility that a people
who could sew, spin, and weave, might also have been
skilled in knitting, and that the jersey and jumper may
have a respectable antiquity. The art of knitting is
closely related to that of basket-making, and some would
have it that many of the earliest potters plastered their
clay inside baskets of reeds, and that the decorations of
the early pots were suggested by the markings impressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
by these. It is of interest to note in this connection that
some Roman wares were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bascaudæ</i>, or "baskets",
and that the Welsh <i lang="lcy" xml:lang="cy">basged</i>&mdash;<i lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">basg</i>, from which our word
"basket" is derived, signify "network" and "plaiting".
The decoration of some pots certainly suggests
the imitation of wickerwork and knitting, but there are
symbols also, and these had, no doubt, a religious
significance.</p>

<p>It does not follow, of course, that all the Early Britons
of the so-called Stone Age were in the same stage of
civilization, or that they all pursued the same modes of
life. There were then, as there are now, backward as
well as progressive communities and individuals, and
there were likewise representatives of different races&mdash;tall
and short, spare and stout, dark and fair men and
women, who had migrated at different periods from
different areas of origin and characterization. Some
peoples clung to the sea-shore, and lived mainly on
deep-sea fish and shell-fish; others were forest and
moorland hunters, who never ventured to sea or cultivated
the soil. There is no evidence to indicate that
conflicts took place between different communities. It
may be that in the winter season the hunters occasionally
raided the houses and barns of the agriculturists. The
fact, however, that weapons were not common during
the Stone Age cannot be overlooked in this connection.
The military profession had not come into existence.</p>

<p>Certain questions, however, arise in connection with
even the most backward of the Stone Age peoples.
How did they reach Britain, and what attracted them
from the Continent? Man did not take to the sea except
under dire necessity, and it is certain that large numbers
could not possibly have crossed the English Channel on
logs of wood. The boatbuilder's craft and the science
of navigation must have advanced considerably before
large migrations across the sea could have taken place.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
When the agricultural mode of life was introduced, the
early people obtained the seeds of wheat and barley,
and, as these cultivated grasses do not grow wild in
Britain, they must have been introduced either by traders
or settlers.</p>

<p>It is quite evident that the term "Stone Age" is
inadequate in so far as it applies to the habits of life
pursued by the early inhabitants of our native land.
Nor is it even sufficient in dealing with artifacts, for
some people made more use of horn and bone than of
stone, and these were represented among the early
settlers in Britain.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<small>Earliest Traces of Modern Man</small></h2>

<p class="blockquote">The Culture Ages&mdash;Ancient Races&mdash;The Neanderthals&mdash;Crô-Magnon
Man&mdash;The Evolution Theory&mdash;Palæolithic Ages&mdash;The Transition Period&mdash;Neanderthal
Artifacts&mdash;Birth of Crô-Magnon Art&mdash;Occupations of Flint-yielding
Stations&mdash;Ravages of Disease&mdash;Duration of Glacial and Inter-glacial
Periods.</p>

<p>In 1865, Sir John Lubbock (afterwards Lord Avebury),
writing in the <cite>Prehistoric Times</cite>, suggested that
the Stone Age artifacts found in Western Europe should
be classified into two main periods, to which he applied
the terms Palæolithic (Old Stone) and Neolithic (New
Stone). The foundations of the classification had previously
been laid by the French antiquaries M. Boucher
de Perthes and Edouard Lartet. It was intended that
Palæolithic should refer to rough stone implements, and
Neolithic to those of the period when certain artifacts
were polished.</p>

<p>At the time very little was known regarding the early
peoples who had pursued the flint-chipping and polishing
industries, and the science of geology was in its
infancy. A great controversy, which continued for many
years, was being waged in scientific circles regarding
the remains of a savage primitive people that had been
brought to light. Of these the most notable were a
woman's skull found in 1848 in a quarry at Gibraltar,
the Cannstadt skull, found in 1700, which had long
been lying in Stuttgart Museum undescribed and unstudied,
and portions of a male skeleton taken from a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
limestone cave in Neanderthal, near Dusseldorf, in 1857.
Some refused to believe that these, and other similar
remains subsequently discovered, were human at all;
others declared that the skulls were those of idiots or
that they had been distorted by disease. Professor
Huxley contended that evidence had been forthcoming
to prove the existence in remote times of a primitive
race from which modern man had evolved.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary here to review the prolonged controversy.
One of its excellent results was the stimulation
of research work. A number of important finds
have been made during the present century, which have
thrown a flood of light on the problem. In 1908 a
skeleton was discovered in a grotto near La Chapelle-aux-Saints
in France, which definitely established the fact
that during the earlier or lower period of the Palæolithic
Age a Neanderthal race existed on the Continent, and,
as other remains testify, in England as well. This race
became extinct. Some hold that there are no living
descendants of Neanderthal man on our globe; others
contend that some peoples, or individuals, reveal
Neanderthaloid traits. The natives of Australia display
certain characteristics of the extinct species, but they are
more closely related to Modern Man (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Homo sapiens</i>).
There were pre-Neanderthal peoples, including Piltdown
man and Heidelberg man.</p>

<p>During the Palæolithic Age the ancestors of modern
man appeared in Western Europe. These are now
known as the Crô-Magnon races.</p>

<p>In dealing with the Palæolithic Age, therefore, it has
to be borne in mind that the artifacts classified by the
archæologists represent the activities, not only of different
races, but of representatives of different species of
humanity. Neanderthal man, who differed greatly from
Modern man, is described as follows by Professor Elliot
Smith:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquote">"His short, thick-set, and coarsely built body was carried
in a half-stooping slouch upon short, powerful, and half-flexed
legs of peculiarly ungraceful form. His thick neck
sloped forward from the broad shoulders to support the
massive flattened head, which protruded forward, so as to
form an unbroken curve of neck and back, in place of the
alteration of curves, which is one of the graces of the truly
erect <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Homo sapiens</i>. The heavy overhanging eyebrow ridges,
and retreating forehead, the great coarse face, with its large
eye-sockets, broad nose, and receding chin, combined to
complete the picture of unattractiveness, which it is more
probable than not was still further emphasized by a shaggy
covering of hair over most of the body. The arms were
relatively short, and the exceptionally large hands lacked the
delicacy and the nicely balanced co-operation of thumb and
fingers, which is regarded as one of the most distinctive of
human characteristics."<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>As Professor Osborn says: "the structure of the hand
is a matter of the highest interest in connection with the
implement-making powers of the Neanderthals". He
notes that in the large and robust Neanderthal hand,
"the joint of the metacarpal bone which supports the
thumb is of peculiar form, convex, and presenting a
veritable convex condyle, whereas in the existing human
races the articular surface of the upper part of the thumb
joint is saddle-shaped, that is concave from within backward,
and convex from without inward". The Neanderthal
fingers were "relatively short and robust".<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The Crô-Magnons present a sharp contrast to the
Neanderthals. In all essential features they were of
modern type. They would, dressed in modern attire,
pass through the streets of a modern city without particular
notice being taken of them. One branch of the
Crô-Magnons was particularly tall and handsome, with
an average height for the males of 6 feet 1-1/2 inches, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
chests very broad in the upper part, and remarkably
long shin-bones that indicate swiftness of foot. The
Neanderthals had short shins and bent knees, and their
gait must have been slow and awkward. The Crô-Magnon
hand was quite like that of the most civilized
men of to-day.</p>

<p>It is of importance to bring out these facts in connection
with the study of the development of early
civilization in our native land, because of the prevalence
of the theory that in collections of stone implements,
dating from remote Palæolithic times till the Neolithic
Age, a complete and orderly series of evolutionary stages
can be traced. "As like needs", says one writer in this
connection, "produce like means of satisfaction, the
contrivances with which men in similar stages of progress
overcome natural obstacles are in all times very
much the same."<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Hugh Miller, the Cromarty stonemason
and geologist, was one of the first to urge this
view. In 1835, he wrote in his <cite>Scenes and Legends</cite>,
(1st edition, pp. 31, 32):</p>

<p class="blockquote">"Man in a savage stage is the same animal everywhere,
and his constructive powers, whether employed in the formation
of a legendary story or of a battleaxe, seem to expatiate
almost everywhere in the same rugged track of invention.
For even the traditions of this first stage may be identified,
like its weapons of war, all the world over."<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>He had written in this vein after seeing the collection
of stone weapons and implements in the Northern Institution
at Inverness. "The most practised eye", he
commented, "can hardly distinguish between the
weapons of the Old Scot and the New Zealander."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
Eyes have become more practised in dealing with flints
since Miller's time. Andrew Lang remembered his
Miller when he wrote:</p>

<p class="blockquote">"Now just as the flint arrowheads are scattered everywhere,
in all the continents and isles&mdash;and everywhere are much
alike, and bear no very definite marks of the special influence
of race&mdash;so it is with the habits and legends investigated by
the student of folk-lore".<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The recent discovery that the early flints found in
Western Europe and in England were shaped by the
Neanderthals and the pre-Neanderthals compels a revision
of this complacent view of an extraordinarily
difficult and complex problem. It is obvious that the
needs and constructive powers of the Neanderthals,
whose big clumsy hands lacked "the delicate play between
the thumb and fingers characteristic of modern
races", could not have been the same as those of the
Crô-Magnons, and that the finely shaped implements of
the Crô-Magnons could not have been evolved from the
rough implements of the Neanderthals. The craftsmen
of one race may, however, have imitated, or attempted
to imitate, the technique of those of another.</p>

<p>There was a distinct break in the continuity of culture
during the Palæolithic Age, caused by the arrival in
Western Europe of the ancestors of Modern Man. The
advent of the Crô-Magnons in Europe "represents on
the cultural side", as Professor Elliot Smith says in
<cite>Primitive Man</cite>, "the most momentous event in its
history".</p>

<p>EXAMPLES OF LOWER PALÆOLITHIC INDUSTRIES<br />
FOUND IN ENGLAND<br />
(British Museum)</p>
</div></div>

<p>Some urge that the term "Palæolithic" should now
be discarded altogether, but its use has become so firmly
established that archæologists are loth to dispense with
it. The first period of human culture has, however,
had to be divided into "Lower" and "Upper Palæolithic"&mdash;Lower
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
closing with the disappearance of the
Neanderthals, and Upper beginning with the arrival of
the Crô-Magnons. These periods embrace the sub-divisions
detected during the latter half of last century
by the French archæologists, and are now classified as
follows:</p>

<p>Lower Palæolithic&mdash;</p>

<p class="hanging">1. Pre-Chellean.</p>

<p class="hanging">2. Chellean (named after the town of Chelles, east
of Paris).</p>

<p class="hanging">3. Acheulian (named after St. Acheul in Somme
valley).</p>

<p class="hanging">4. Mousterian (named after the caves of Le Moustier
in the valley of the River Vézère).</p>

<p>Upper Palæolithic&mdash;</p>

<p class="hanging">1. Aurignacian (named after Aurignac, Haute
Garonne).</p>

<p class="hanging">2. Solutrean (named after Solutré, Saône-et-Loire).</p>

<p class="hanging">3. Magdalenian (named after La Madeleine in the
valley of the River Vézère).</p>

<p>Then follows, in France, the Azilian stage (named
after Mas d'Azil, a town at the foot of the Pyrenees)
which is regarded as the link between Upper Palæolithic
and Neolithic. But in Western Europe, including
Britain, there were really three distinct cultures during
the so-called "Transition Period". These are the
Azilian, the Tardenoisian, and the Maglemosian. These
cultures were associated with the movements of new
peoples in Europe.</p>

<p>The pre-Chellean flints (also called Eoliths) were
wrought by the pre-Neanderthals. Chellean probably
represents the earliest work in Europe of a pre-Neanderthal
type like Piltdown man. The most characteristic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
implement of this phase is the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de poing</i> or pear-shaped
"hand axe", which was at first roughly shaped
and unsymmetrical. It was greatly improved during
the Acheulian stage, and after being finely wrought in
Mousterian times, when it was not much used, was
supplanted by smaller and better chipped implements.
The Neanderthals practised the Mousterian industry.</p>

<div class="image-left">

<div class="caption">
<p>Chellean <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Coup de Poing</i> or "Hand Axe"<br />
Right-hand view shows sinuous cutting edge.</p>
</div></div>

<p>A profound change occurred
when the Aurignacian
stage of culture
was inaugurated by the
intruding Crô-Magnons.
Skilled workers chipped
flint in a new way, and,
like the contemporary inhabitants
of North Africa,
shaped artifacts from
bone; they also used reindeer
horn, and the ivory
tusks of mammoths. The
birth of pictorial art took
place in Europe after the
Crô-Magnons arrived.</p>

<p>It would appear that
the remnants of the Neanderthals in the late Mousterian
stage of culture were stimulated by the arrival of the
Crô-Magnons to imitate new flint forms and adopt the
new methods of workmanship. There is no other evidence
to indicate that the Crô-Magnons came into contact
with communities of the Neanderthals. In these
far-off days Europe was thinly peopled by hunters who
dwelt in caves. The climate was cold, and the hairy
mammoth and the reindeer browsed in the lowlands of
France and Germany. Italy was linked with Africa;
the grass-lands of North Africa stretched southward
across the area now known as the Sahara desert, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
dense forests fringed the banks of the River Nile and
extended eastward to the Red Sea.</p>

<p>Neanderthal man had originally entered Europe when
the climate was much milder than it is in our own time.
He crossed over from Africa by the Italian land-bridge,
and he found African fauna, including species of the
elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, lion, and the
hyæna, jackal, and sabre-tooth tiger in Spain, France,
Germany. Thousands of years elapsed and the summers
became shorter, and the winters longer and more severe,
until the northern fauna began to migrate southward,
and the African fauna deserted the plains and decaying
forests of Europe. Then followed the Fourth Glacial
phase, and when it was passing away the Neanderthals,
who had long been in the Mousterian phase of culture,
saw bands of Crô-Magnons prospecting and hunting in
southern Europe. The new-comers had migrated from
some centre of culture in North Africa, and appear to
have crossed over the Italian land-bridge. It is unlikely
that many, if any, entered Europe from the east. At
the time the Black Sea was more than twice its present
size, and glaciers still blocked the passes of Asia
Minor.</p>

<p>A great contrast was presented by the two types of
mankind. The short, powerfully built, but slouching
and slow-footed Neanderthals were, in a conflict, no
match for the tall, active, and swift-footed Crô-Magnons,
before whom they retreated, yielding up their flint-working
stations, and their caves and grottoes. It may be,
as some suggest, that fierce battles were fought, but
there is no evidence of warfare; it may be that the
Neanderthals succumbed to imported diseases, as did so
many thousands of the inhabitants of the Amazon Valley,
when measles and other diseases were introduced by
the Spaniards. The fact remains that the Neanderthals
died out as completely as did the Tasmanians

before the advance of British settlers. We do not know
whether or not they resisted, for a time, the intrusion of
strangers on their hunting-grounds. It may be that the
ravages of disease completed the tragic history of such
relations as they may have had with the ancestors of
Modern Man.</p>

<p>At this point, before we deal with the arrival in
Britain of the representatives of the early races, it
should be noted that differences of opinion exist among
scientists regarding the geological horizons of the Palæolithic
culture stages. In the Pleistocene Age there appear
to have been four great glacial epochs and two
minor ones. Geological opinion is, however, divided
in this connection.</p>

<p>WESTERN EUROPE DURING THE THIRD<br />
INTER-GLACIAL EPOCH</p>

<p><span class="small">(According to the Abbé Breuil the Strait of Gibraltar was open and the<br />
Balearic group a great island.)</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>During the First Glacial epoch the musk-ox, now
found in the Arctic regions, migrated as far south as
Sussex. The Pliocene<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> mammals were not, however,
completely exterminated; many of them survived until
the First Interglacial epoch, which lasted for about
75,000 years&mdash;that is three times longer than the First
Glacial epoch. The Second Glacial epoch is believed
to have extended over 25,000 years. It brought to the
southern shores of the Baltic Sea the reindeer and the
hairy mammoth. Then came the prolonged Second
Interglacial stage which prevailed for about 200,000
years. The climate of Europe underwent a change
until it grew warmer than it is at the present day,
and trees, not now found farther north than the Canary
Islands, flourished in the forests of southern France.
The Third Glacial stage gradually came on, grew in
intensity, and then declined during a period estimated
at about 25,000 years. It was followed by the Third
Interglacial epoch which may have extended over at
least 100,000 years. African animals returned to Europe
and mingled with those that wandered from Asia and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
the survivors in Europe of the Second Interglacial fauna.
The Fourth Glacial epoch, which is believed to have
lasted for about 25,000 years, was very severe. All the
African or Asiatic mammals either migrated or became
extinct with the exception of lions and hyænas, and the
reindeer found the western plains of Europe as congenial
as it does the northern plains at the present
time.</p>

<p>During the Fourth Post-glacial epoch there were for
a period of about 25,000 years<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> partial glaciations and
milder intervals, until during the Neolithic Age of the
archæologists the climate of Europe reached the phase
that at present prevails.</p>

<p>When, then, did man first appear in Europe? According
to some geologists, and especially Penck and
James Geikie, the Chellean phase of culture originated
in the Second Interglacial epoch and the Mousterian
endured until the Third Interglacial stage, when the
Neanderthals witnessed the arrival of the Crô-Magnon
peoples. Boule, Breuil, and others, however, place the
pre-Chellean, Chellean, Acheulian, and early Mousterian
stages of Lower (or Early) Palæolithic culture in the
Third Interglacial epoch, and fix the extermination of
Neanderthal man, in his late Mousterian culture stage,
at the close of the Fourth Glacial epoch. This view is
now being generally accepted. It finds favour with the
archæologists, and seems to accord with the evidence
they have accumulated. The Upper Palæolithic culture
of Crô-Magnon man, according to some, began in its
Aurignacian phase about 25,000 years ago; others consider,
however, that it began about five or six thousand
years ago, and was contemporaneous with the long pre-Dynastic
civilization of Egypt. At the time England
was connected with the Continent by a land-bridge,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
and as the climate grew milder the ancestors of modern
man could walk across from France to the white cliffs of
Dover which were then part of a low range of mountains.
As will be shown, there is evidence that the
last land movement in Britain did not begin until about
3000 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></p>

<p>The earliest discovery of a representative of the Crô-Magnons
was made in 1823, when Dr. Buckland explored
the ancient cave-dwelling of Paviland in the
vicinity of Rhossilly, Gower Peninsula, South Wales.
This cave, known as "Goat's Hole", is situated between
30 and 40 feet above the present sea-level, on the face
of a steep sandstone cliff about 100 feet in height; it is
60 feet in length and 200 feet broad, while the roof
attains an altitude of over 25 feet. When this commodious
natural shelter was occupied by our remote
ancestors the land was on a much lower level than it
is now, and it could be easily reached from the sea-shore.
Professor Sollas has shown that the Paviland
cave-dwellers were in the Aurignacian stage of culture,
and that they had affinities with the tall Crô-Magnon
peoples on the Continent.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
A human skeleton of a tall man was found in the
cave deposit in association with the skull and tusks of a
hairy mammoth, and with implements of Aurignacian
type. Apparently the Aurignacian colonists had walked
over the land-bridge connecting England with France
many centuries before the land sank and the Channel
tides began to carve out the white cliffs of Dover.</p>

<p>In his description of the bones of the ancient caveman,
who has been wrongly referred to as the "Red
Lady of Paviland", Dr. Buckland wrote:</p>

<p class="blockquote">"They were all of them stained superficially with a dark
brick-red colour, and enveloped by a coating of a kind of
ruddle, composed of red micaceous oxide of iron, which
stained the earth, and in some parts extended itself to the
distance of about half an inch around the surface of the
bones. The body must have been entirely surrounded or
covered over at the time of its interment with this red
substance."</p>

<p>Near the thighs were about two handfuls of small
shells (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nerita litoralis</i>) which had evidently formed a
waist girdle. Over forty little rods of ivory, which may
have once formed a long necklace, lay near the ribs.
A few ivory rings and a tongue-shaped implement or
ornament lay beside the body, as well as an instrument
or charm made of the metacarpal bone of a wolf.</p>

<p>The next great discovery of this kind was made
twenty-nine years later. In 1852 a French workman
was trying to catch a wild rabbit on a lower slope of the
Pyrenees, near the town of Aurignac in Haute Garonne,
when he made a surprising find. From the rabbit's
burrow he drew out a large human bone. A slab of
stone was subsequently removed, and a grotto or cave
shelter revealed. In the debris were found portions of
seventeen skeletons of human beings of different ages
and both sexes. Only two skulls were intact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
This discovery created a stir in the town of Aurignac,
and there was much speculation regarding the tragedy
that was supposed to have taken place at some distant
date. A few folks were prepared to supply circumstantial
details by connecting the discovery with vague local
traditions. No one dreamt that the burial-place dated
back a few thousand years, or, indeed, that the grotto
had really been a burial-place, and the mayor of the
town gave instructions that the bones should be interred
in the parish cemetery.</p>

<p>Eight years elapsed before the grotto was visited by
M. Louis Lartet, the great French archæologist. Outside
the stone slab he found the remains of an ancient
hearth, and a stone implement which had been used
for chipping flints. In the outer debris were discovered,
too, the bones of animals of the chase, and
about a hundred flint artifacts, including knives, projectiles,
and sling-stones, besides bone arrows, tools
shaped from reindeer horns, and an implement like
a bodkin of roe-deer horn. It transpired that the
broken bones of animals included those of the cave-lion,
the cave-bear, the hyæna, the elk, the mammoth,
and the woolly-haired rhinoceros&mdash;all of which had
been extinct in that part of the world for thousands of
years.</p>

<p>As in the Paviland cave, there were indications that
the dead had been interred with ornaments or charms
on their bodies. Inside the grotto were found "eighteen
small round and flat plates of a white shelly substance,
made of some species of cockle (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cardium</i>) pierced
through the middle, as if for being strung into a bracelet".
Perforated teeth of wild animals had evidently
been used for a like purpose.</p>

<p>The distinct industry revealed by the grotto finds has
been named Aurignacian, after Aurignac. Had the
human bones not been removed, the scientists would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
have definitely ascertained what particular race of ancient
men they represented.</p>

<p>It was not until the spring of 1868 that a flood of light
was thrown on the Aurignacian racial problem. A
gang of workmen were engaged in the construction of
a railway embankment in the vicinity of the village of
Crô-Magnon, near Les Eyzies, in the valley of the River
Vézère, when they laid bare another grotto. Intimation
was at once made to the authorities, and the Minister of
Public Instruction caused an investigation to be made
under the direction of M. Louis Lartet. The remains of
five human skeletons were found. At the back of the
grotto was the skull of an old man&mdash;now known as "the
old man of Crô-Magnon"&mdash;and its antiquity was at once
emphasized by the fact that some parts of it were coated
by stalagmite caused by a calcareous drip from the roof
of rock. Near "the old man" was found the skeleton
of a woman. Her forehead bore signs of a deep wound
that had been made by a cutting instrument. As the
inner edge of the bone had partly healed, it was apparent
she had survived her injury for a few weeks. Beside
her lay the skeleton of a baby which had been prematurely
born. The skeletons of two young men were
found not far from those of the others. Apparently a
tragic happening had occurred in ancient days in the
vicinity of the Crô-Magnon grotto. The victims had
been interred with ceremony, and in accordance with
the religious rites prevailing at the time. Above three
hundred pierced marine shells, chiefly of the periwinkle
species (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Littorina littorea</i>), which are common on the
Atlantic coasts, and a few shells of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Purpura lapillus</i> (a
purple-yielding shell), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turitella communis</i>, &amp;c., were
discovered besides the skeletons. These, it would appear,
had been strung to form necklaces and other
ornamental charms. M. Lartet found, too, a flat ivory
pendant pierced with two holes, and was given two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
other pendants picked up by young people. Near the
skeletons were several perforated teeth, a split block of
gneiss with a smooth surface, the worked antlers of a
reindeer that may have been used as a pick for excavating
flint, and a few chipped flints. Other artifacts of
Aurignacian type were unearthed in the debris associated
with the grotto, which appears to have been used as a
dwelling-place before the interments had taken place.</p>

<p>Skull of a Crô-Magnon Man: front and side views<br />
From the Grotte des Enfants, Mentone. (After Verneau.)</p>
</div></div>

<p>The human remains of the Crô-Magnon grotto were
those of a tall and handsome race of which the "Red
Man" of Paviland was a representative. Other finds
have shown that this race was widely distributed in
Europe. The stature of the men varied from 5 feet 10-1/2
inches to 6 feet 4-1/2 inches on the Riviera, that of the women
being slightly less. That the Crô-Magnons were people
of high intelligence is suggested by the fact that the skulls
of the men and women were large, and remarkably well
developed in the frontal region. According to a prominent
anatomist the Crô-Magnon women had bigger brains
than has the average male European of to-day. All
these ancient skulls are of the dolichocephalic (long-headed)
type. The faces, however, were comparatively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
broad, and shorter than those of the modern fair North-Europeans,
while the cheek-bones were high&mdash;a characteristic,
by the way, of so many modern Scottish faces.</p>

<p>This type of head&mdash;known as the "disharmonic",
because a broad face is usually a characteristic of a
broad skull, and a long face of a long skull&mdash;has been
found to be fairly common among the modern inhabitants
of the Dordogne valley. These French descendants
of the Crô-Magnons are, however, short and "stocky",
and most of them have dark hair and eyes. Crô-Magnon
types have likewise been identified among the Berbers
of North Africa, and the extinct fair-haired Guanches
of the Canary Islands, in Brittany, on the islands of
northern Holland, and in the British Isles.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>A comparatively short race, sometimes referred to as
the "Combe-Capelle", after the rock-shelter at Combe-Capelle,
near Montferrand, Perigord, was also active
during the stage of Aurignacian culture. An adult
skeleton found in this shelter was that of a man only
5 feet 3 inches in height. The skull is long and narrow,
with a lofty forehead, and the chin small and well developed.
It has some similarity to modern European
skulls. The skeleton had been subjected for thousands
of years to the dripping of water saturated with lime,
and had consequently been well preserved. Near the
head and neck lay a large number of perforated marine
shells (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Littorina</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nassa</i>). A collection of finely-worked
flints of early Aurignacian type also lay beside
the body.</p>

<p>Reference may also be made here to the finds in
Moravia. Fragmentary skull caps from Brüx and Brünn
are regarded as evidence of a race which differed from
the tall Crô-Magnons, and had closer affinities with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
Combe-Capelle man. Some incline to connect the Brünn
type with England, the link being provided by a skeleton
called the "Galley Hill" after the place of its discovery
below Gravesend and near Northfleet in Kent.
Scientists regard him as a contemporary of the Aurignacian
flint-workers of Combe-Capelle and Brünn.
"Both the Brüx and Brünn skulls", writes Professor
Osborn, "are harmonic; they do not present the very
broad, high cheek-bones characteristic of the Crô-Magnon
race,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> the face being of a narrow modern type, but
not very long. There is a possibility that the Brünn
race was ancestral to several later dolichocephalic groups
which are found in the region of the Danube and of
middle and southern Germany."<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The Galley Hill man had been buried in the gravels
of the "high terrace", 90 feet above the Thames. His
bones when found were much decayed and denuded,
and the skull contorted. The somewhat worn "wisdom
tooth" indicates that he was a "fully-grown adult,
though probably not an aged individual". Those who
think he was not as old as the flints and the bones of
extinct animals found in the gravels, regard him as a
pioneer of the Brünn branch of the Aurignacians.</p>

<p>The Piltdown skull appears to date back to a period
vastly more ancient than Neanderthal times.</p>

<p>Our special interest in the story of early man in
Britain is with the "Red Man" of Paviland and
Galley Hill man, because these were representatives of
the species to which we ourselves belong. The Neanderthals
and pre-Neanderthals, who have left their
Eoliths and Palæoliths in our gravels, vanished like the
glaciers and the icebergs, and have left, as has been
indicated, no descendants in our midst. Our history
begins with the arrival of the Crô-Magnon races, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
were followed in time by other peoples to whom Europe
offered attractions during the period of the great thaw,
when the ice-cap was shrinking towards the north, and
the flooded rivers were forming the beds on which they
now flow.</p>

<p>We have little to learn from Galley Hill man. His
geological horizon is uncertain, but the balance of the
available evidence tends to show he was a pioneer of
the medium-sized hunters who entered Europe from the
east, during the Aurignacian stage of culture. It is
otherwise with the "Red Man" of Wales. We know
definitely what particular family he belonged to; he was
a representative of the tall variety of Crô-Magnons. We
know too that those who loved him, and laid his lifeless
body in the Paviland Cave, had introduced into
Europe the germs of a culture that had been radiated
from some centre, probably in the ancient forest land to
the east of the Nile, along the North African coast at
a time when it jutted far out into the Mediterranean and
the Sahara was a grassy plain.</p>

<p>The Crô-Magnons were no mere savages who lived
the life of animals and concerned themselves merely
with their material needs. They appear to have been
a people of active, inventive, and inquiring minds, with
a social organization and a body of definite beliefs,
which found expression in their art and in their burial
customs. The "Red Man" was so called by the
archæologists because his bones and the earth beside
them were stained, as has been noted, by "red micaceous
oxide of iron". Here we meet with an ancient
custom of high significance. It was not the case, as
some have suggested, that the skeleton was coloured
after the flesh had decayed. There was no indication
when the human remains were discovered that the grave
had been disturbed after the corpse was laid in it. The
fact that the earth as well as the bones retained the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
coloration affords clear proof that the corpse had been
smeared over with red earth which, after the flesh had
decayed, fell on the skeleton and the earth and gravel
beside it. But why, it will be asked, was the corpse so
treated? Did the Crô-Magnons paint their bodies during
life, as do the Australians, the Red Indians, and
others, to provide "a substitute for clothing"? That
cannot be the reason. They could not have concerned
themselves about a "substitute" for something they did
not possess. In France, the Crô-Magnons have left
pictorial records of their activities and interests in their
caves and other shelters. Bas reliefs on boulders within
a shelter at Laussel show that they did not wear clothing
during the Aurignacian epoch which continued for
many long centuries. We know too that the Australians
and Indians painted their bodies for religious and
magical purposes&mdash;to protect themselves in battle or
enable them to perform their mysteries&mdash;rain-getting,
food-getting, and other ceremonies. The ancient Egyptians
painted their gods to "make them healthy".
Prolonged good health was immortality.</p>

<p>The evidence afforded by the Paviland and other Crô-Magnon
burials indicates that the red colour was freshly
applied before the dead was laid in the sepulchre.
No doubt it was intended to serve a definite purpose,
that it was an expression of a system of beliefs regarding
life and the hereafter.</p>

<p>Apparently among the Crô-Magnons the belief was
already prevalent that the "blood is the life". The
loss of life appeared to them to be due to the loss of the
red vitalizing fluid which flowed in the veins. Strong
men who received wounds in conflict with their fellows,
or with wild animals, were seen to faint and die in consequence
of profuse bleeding; and those who were
stricken with sickness grew ashen pale because, as it
seemed, the supply of blood was insufficient, a condition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
they may have accounted for, as did the Babylonians of
a later period, by conceiving that demons entered the
body and devoured the flesh and blood. It is not too
much to suppose that they feared death, and that like
other Pagan religions of antiquity theirs was deeply concerned
with the problem of how to restore and prolong
life. Their medicine-men appear to have arrived at the
conclusion that the active principle in blood was the
substance that coloured it, and they identified this substance
with red earth. If cheeks grew pale in sickness,
the flush of health seemed to be restored by the application
of a red face paint. The patient did not invariably
regain strength, but when he did, the recovery was in
all likelihood attributed to the influence of the blood
substitute. Rest and slumber were required, as experience
showed, to work the cure. When death took place,
it seemed to be a deeper and more prolonged slumber,
and the whole body was smeared over with the vitalizing
blood substitute so that, when the spell of weakness had
passed away, the sleeper might awaken, and come forth
again with renewed strength from the cave-house in
which he had been laid.</p>

<p>The many persistent legends about famous "sleepers"
that survive till our own day appear to have originally
been connected with a belief in the return of the dead,
the antiquity of which we are not justified in limiting,
especially when it is found that the beliefs connected
with body paint and shell ornaments and amulets were
introduced into Europe in early post-glacial times.
Ancient folk heroes might be forgotten, but from Age
to Age there arose new heroes to take their places; the
habit of placing them among the sleepers remained.
Charlemagne, Frederick of Barbarossa, William Tell,
King Arthur, the Fians, and the Irish Brian Boroimhe,
are famous sleepers. French peasants long believed
that the sleeping Napoleon would one day return to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
protect their native land from invaders, and during the
Russo-Japanese war it was whispered in Russia that
General Skobeleff would suddenly awake and hasten to
Manchuria to lead their troops to victory. For many
generations the Scots were convinced that James IV,
who fell at Flodden, was a "sleeper". His place was taken
in time by Thomas the Rhymer, who slept in a cave
and occasionally awoke to visit markets so that he might
purchase horses for the great war which was to redden
Tweed and Clyde with blood. Even in our own day
there were those who refused to believe that General
Gordon, Sir Hector MacDonald, and Lord Kitchener,
were really dead. The haunting belief in sleeping
heroes dies hard.</p>

<p>Among the famous groups of sleeping heroes are the
Seven Sleepers of Ephesus&mdash;the Christians who had
been condemned to death by the Emperor Decius and
concealed themselves in a cave where they slept for
three and a half centuries. An eighteenth century
legend tells of seven men in Roman attire, who lay
in a cave in Western Germany. In Norse Mythology,
the seven sons of Mimer sleep in the Underworld awaiting
the blast of the horn, which will be blown at
Ragnarok when the gods and demons will wage the
last battle. The sleepers of Arabia once awoke to foretell
the coming of Mahomet, and their sleeping dog,
according to Moslem beliefs, is one of the ten animals
that will enter Paradise.</p>

<p>A representative Scottish legend regarding the
sleepers is located at the Cave of Craigiehowe in the
Black Isle, Ross-shire, a few miles distant from the
Rosemarkie cave. It is told that a shepherd once
entered the cave and saw the sleepers and their dog.
A horn, or as some say, a whistle, hung suspended from
the roof. The shepherd blew it once and the sleepers
shook themselves; he blew a second time, and they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
opened their eyes and raised themselves on their elbows.
Terrified by the forbidding aspect of the mighty men,
the shepherd refrained from blowing a third time, but
turned and fled. As he left the cave he heard one of the
heroes call after him: "Alas! you have left us worse
than you found us." As whistles are sometimes found
in Magdalenian shelters in Western and Central Europe,
it may be that these were at an early period connected
with the beliefs about the calling back of the Crô-Magnon
dead. The ancient whistles were made of hare&mdash;and
reindeer-foot bone. The clay whistle dates from
the introduction of the Neolithic industry in Hungary.</p>

<p>The remarkable tendency on the part of mankind to
cling to and perpetuate ancient beliefs and customs, and
especially those connected with sickness and death, is
forcibly illustrated by the custom of smearing the bodies
of the living and dead with red ochre. In every part
of the world red is regarded as a particularly "lucky
colour", which protects houses and human beings, and
imparts vitality to those who use it. The belief in the
protective value of red berries is perpetuated in our
own Christmas customs when houses are decorated with
holly, and by those dwellers in remote parts who still
tie rowan berries to their cows' tails so as to prevent
witches and fairies from interfering with the milk supply.
Egyptian women who wore a red jasper in their waist-girdles
called the stone "a drop of the blood of Isis (the
mother goddess)".</p>

<p>Red symbolism is everywhere connected with lifeblood
and the "vital spark"&mdash;the hot "blood of
life". Brinton<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> has shown that in the North American
languages the word for blood is derived from the word
for red or the word for fire. The ancient Greek custom
of painting red the wooden images of gods was evidently
connected with the belief that a supply of lifeblood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
was thus assured, and that the colour animated
the Deity, as Homer's ghosts were animated by a blood
offering when Odysseus visited Hades. "The anointing
of idols with blood for the purpose of animating
them is", says Farnell, "a part of old Mediterranean
magic."<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The ancient Egyptians, as has been indicated,
painted their gods, some of whom wore red
garments; a part of their underworld Dewat was "Red
Land", and there were "red souls" in it.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> In India
standing stones connected with deities are either painted
red or smeared with the blood of a sacrificed animal.
The Chinese regard red as the colour of fire and light,
and in their philosophy they identify it with <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">Yang</i>, the
chief principle of life;<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> it is believed "to expel pernicious
influences, and thus particularly to symbolize
good luck, happiness, delight, and pleasure". Red
coffins are favoured. The "red gate" on the south
side of a cemetery "is never opened except for the
passage of an Emperor".<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The Chinese put a powdered
red stone called <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">hun-hong</i> in a drink or in food to destroy
an evil spirit which may have taken possession of one.
Red earth is eaten for a similar reason by the Polynesians
and others. Many instances of this kind could
be given to illustrate the widespread persistence of the
belief in the vitalizing and protective qualities associated
with red substances. In Irish Gaelic, Professor
W. J. Watson tells me, "ruadh" means both "red"
and "strong".</p>

<p>The Crô-Magnons regarded the heart as the seat of
life, having apparently discovered that it controls the
distribution of blood. In the cavern of Pindal, in south-western
France, is the outline of a hairy mammoth
painted in red ochre, and the seat of life is indicated by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
a large red heart. The painting dates back to the early
Aurignacian period. In other cases, as in the drawing
of a large bison in the cavern of Niaux, the seat of life
and the vulnerable parts are indicated by spear&mdash;or
arrowheads incised on the body. The ancient Egyptians
identified the heart with the mind. To them the
heart was the seat of intelligence and will-power as well
as the seat of life. The germ of this belief can apparently
be found in the
pictorial art and burial
customs of the Aurignacian
Crô-Magnons.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Another interesting
burial custom has been
traced in the Grimaldi
caves. Some of the
skeletons were found to
have small green stones
between their teeth or
inside their mouths.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
No doubt these were
amulets. Their colour
suggests that green symbolism
has not necessarily
a connection with agricultural religion, as some
have supposed. The Crô-Magnons do not appear to
have paid much attention to vegetation. In ancient
Egypt the green stone (Khepera) amulet "typified the
germ of life". A text says, "A scarab of green stone ... shall
be placed in the heart of a man, and it shall
perform for him the 'opening of the mouth'"&mdash;that is, it
will enable him to speak and eat again. The scarab is
addressed in a funerary text, "My heart, my mother.
My heart whereby I came into being." It is believed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Budge that the Egyptian custom of "burying green
basalt scarabs inside or on the breasts of the dead" is as
old as the first Dynasty (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">c.</i> 3400 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>).<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> How much older
it is one can only speculate. "The Mexicans", according
to Brinton, "were accustomed to say that at one
time all men have been stones, and that at last they
would all return to stones, and acting literally on this
conviction they interred with the bones of the dead a
small green stone, which was called 'the principle of
life'."<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> In China the custom of placing jade tongue
amulets for the purpose of preserving the dead from
decay and stimulating the soul to take flight to Paradise
is of considerable antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Crystals and pebbles have
been found in ancient British graves. It may well be
that these pebbles were regarded as having had an
intimate connection with deities, and perhaps to have
been coagulated forms of what has been called "life
substance". Of undoubted importance and significance
was the ancient custom of adorning the dead with
shells. As we have seen, this was a notable feature of
the Paviland cave burial. The "Red Man" was not
only smeared with red earth, but "charmed" or protected
by shell amulets. In the next chapter it will be
shown that this custom not only affords us a glimpse
of Aurignacian religious beliefs, but indicates the area
from which the Crô-Magnons came.</p>

<p>Professor G. Elliot Smith was the first to emphasize
the importance attached in ancient times to the beliefs
associated with the divine "giver of life".</p>

<small>Shell Deities and Early Trade</small></h2>

Colours in Palæolithic Caves&mdash;Finger Lore and "Hand Spells".</p>

<p>When the question is asked, "Whence came the Crô-Magnon
people of the Aurignacian phase of culture?"
the answer usually given is, "Somewhere in the East".
The distribution of the Aurignacian sites indicates that
the new-comers entered south-western France by way
of Italy&mdash;that is, across the Italian land-bridge from
North Africa. Of special significance in this connection
is the fact that Aurignacian culture persisted for
the longest period of time in Italy. The tallest Crô-Magnons
appear to have inhabited south-eastern
France and the western shores of Italy. "It is probable",
says Osborn, referring to the men six feet four
and a half inches in height, "that in the genial
climate of the Riviera these men obtained their finest
development; the country was admirably protected
from the cold winds of the north, refuges were abundant,
and game by no means scarce, to judge from the
quantity of animal bones found in the caves. Under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
such conditions of life the race enjoyed a fine physical
development and dispersed widely."<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>It does not follow, however, that the tall people
originated Aurignacian culture. As has been indicated,
the stumpy people represented by Combe-Capelle skeletons
were likewise exponents of it. "It must not be
assumed", as Elliot Smith reminds us, "that the Aurignacian
culture was necessarily invented by the same
people who introduced it into Europe, and whose remains
were associated with it ... for any culture can
be transmitted to an alien people, even when it has not
been adopted by many branches of the race which was
responsible for its invention, just as gas illumination,
oil lamps, and even candles are still in current use by
the people who invented the electric light, which has been
widely adopted by many foreign peoples. This elementary
consideration is so often ignored that it is necessary
thus to emphasize it, because it is essential for any proper
understanding of the history of early civilization."<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>No trace of Aurignacian culture has, so far, been
found outside Europe. "May it not, therefore," it may
be asked, "have originated in Italy or France?" In
absence of direct evidence, this possibility might be
admitted. But an important discovery has been made
at Grimaldi in La Grotte des Enfants (the "grotto of
infants"&mdash;so called because of the discovery there of the
skeletons of young Crô-Magnon children). Among the
shells used as amulets by those who used the grotto as
a sepulchre was one (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cassis rufa</i>) that had been carried
either by a migrating folk, or by traders, along the
North African coast and through Italy from some south-western
Asian beach. The find has been recorded by
Professor Marcellin Boule.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
In a footnote, G. Dollfus writes:</p>

<p class="blockquote">"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cassis rufa, L.</i>, an Indian ocean shell, is represented in
the collection at Monaco by two fragments; one was found
in the lower habitation level D, the other is probably of the
same origin. The presence of this shell is extraordinary, as
it has no analogue in the Mediterranean, neither recent nor
fossil; there exists no species in the North Atlantic or off
Senegal with which it could be confounded. The fragments
have traces of the reddish colour preserved, and are not
fossil; one of them presents a notch which has determined a
hole that seems to have been made intentionally. The species
has not yet been found in the Gulf of Suez nor in the raised
beaches of the Isthmus. M. Jousseaume has found it in the
Gulf of Tadjoura at Aden, but it has not yet been encountered
in the Red Sea nor in the raised beaches of that region.
The common habitat of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cassis rufa</i> is Socotra, besides the
Seychelles, Madagascar, Mauritius, New Caledonia, and
perhaps Tahiti. The fragments discovered at Mentone have
therefore been brought from a great distance at a very
ancient epoch by prehistoric man."</p>

<p>After the Crô-Magnon peoples had spread into Western
and Central Europe they imported shells from the
Mediterranean. At Laugerie Basse in the Dordogne,
for instance, a necklace of pierced shells from the Mediterranean
was found in association with a skeleton.
Atlantic shells could have been obtained from a nearer
sea-shore. It may be that the Rhone valley, which later
became a well-known trade route, was utilized at an
exceedingly remote period, and that cultural influences
occasionally "flowed" along it. "Prehistoric man"
had acquired some experience as a trader even during
the "hunting period", and he had formulated definite
religious beliefs.</p>

<p>It has been the habit of some archæologists to refer to
shell and other necklaces, &amp;c., as "personal ornaments".
The late Dr. Robert Munro wrote in this connection:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquote">"We have no knowledge of any phase of humanity in
which the love of personal ornament does not play an important
part in the life of the individual. The savage of the
present day, who paints or tattoos his body, and adorns it
with shells, feathers, teeth, and trinkets made of the more
gaudy materials at his disposal, may be accepted as on a
parallel with the Neolithic people of Europe.... Teeth
are often perforated and used as pendants, especially the
canines of carnivorous animals, but such ornaments are not
peculiar to Neolithic times, as they were equally prevalent
among the later Palæolithic races of Europe."<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Modern savages have very definite reasons for wearing
the so-called "ornaments", and for painting and tattooing
their bodies. They believe that the shells, teeth,
&amp;c., afford them protection, and bring them luck. Earpiercing,
distending the lobe of the ear, disfiguring the
body, the pointing, blackening, or knocking out of teeth,
are all practices that have a religious significance.
Even such a highly civilized people as the Chinese perpetuate,
in their funerary ceremonies, customs that can
be traced back to an exceedingly remote period in the
history of mankind. It is not due to "love of personal
ornament" that they place cowries, jade, gold, &amp;c., in
the mouth of the dead, but because they believe that by
so doing the body is protected, and given a new lease
of life. The Far Eastern belief that an elixir of ground
oyster shells will prolong life in the next world is
evidently a relic of early shell lore. Certain deities are
associated with certain shells. Some deities have, like
snails, shells for "houses"; others issue at birth from
shells. The goddess Venus (Aphrodite) springs from
the froth of the sea, and is lifted up by Tritons on a
shell; she wears a love-girdle. Hathor, the Egyptian
Venus, had originally a love-girdle of shells. She
appears to have originated as the personification of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
shell, and afterwards to have personified the pearl within
the shell. In early Egyptian graves the shell-amulets
have been found in thousands. The importance of shell
lore in ancient religious systems has been emphasized
by Mr. J. Wilfrid Jackson in his <cite>Shells as Evidence of
the Migrations of Early Culture</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> He shows why the
cowry and snail shells were worn as amulets and
charms, and why men were impelled "to search for
them far and wide and often at great peril". "The
murmur of the shell was the voice of the god, and the
trumpet made of a shell became an important instrument
in initiation ceremonies and in temple worship." Shells
protected wearers against evil, including the evil eye.
In like manner protection was afforded by the teeth and
claws of carnivorous animals. In Asia and Africa the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
belief that tigers, lions, &amp;c., will not injure those who
are thus protected is still quite widespread.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_062.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>Necklace of Sea Shells, from the cave of Crô-Magnon. (After E. Lartet.)</p>
</div></div>

<p>It cannot have been merely for love of personal ornaments
that the Crô-Magnons of southern France imported
Indian Ocean shells, and those of Central and
Western Europe created a trade in Mediterranean shells.
Like the ancient inhabitants of the Nile Valley who in
remote pre-dynastic times imported shells, not only
from the Mediterranean but from the Red Sea, along
a long and dangerous desert trade-route, they evidently
had imparted to shells a definite religious significance.
The "luck-girdle" of snail-shells worn by the "Red
Man of Paviland" has, therefore, an interesting history.
When the Crô-Magnons reached Britain they brought
with them not only implements invented and developed
elsewhere, but a heritage of religious beliefs connected
with shell ornaments and with the red earth with which
the corpse was smeared when laid in its last resting-place.</p>

<p>The ancient religious beliefs connected with shells
appear to have spread far and wide. Traces of them
still survive in districts far separated from one another
and from the area of origin&mdash;the borderlands of Asia
and Africa. In Japanese mythology a young god,
Ohonamochie&mdash;a sort of male Cinderella&mdash;is slain by
his jealous brothers. His mother makes appeal to a sky
deity who sends to her aid the two goddesses Princess
Cockleshell and Princess Clam. Princess Cockleshell
burns and grinds her shell, and with water provided by
Princess Clam prepares an elixir called "nurse's milk"
or "mother's milk". As soon as this "milk" is smeared
over the young god, he is restored to life. In the
Hebrides it is still the custom of mothers to burn and
grind the cockle-shell to prepare a lime-water for children
who suffer from what in Gaelic is called "wasting". In
North America shells of <i>Unio</i> were placed in the graves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
of Red Indians "as food for the dead during the journey
to the land of spirits". The pearls were used in India
as medicines. "The burnt powder of the gems, if taken
with water, cures hæmorrhages, prevents evil spirits
working mischief in men's minds, cures lunacy and all
mental diseases, jaundice, &amp;c.... Rubbed over the
body with other medicines it cures leprosy and all skin
diseases."<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The ancient Cretans, whose culture was
carried into Asia and through Europe by their enterprising
sea-and-land traders and prospectors, attached great
importance to the cockle-shell which they connected
with their mother goddess, the source of all life and the
giver of medicines and food. Sir Arthur Evans found
a large number of cockle-shells, some in Faeince, in the
shrine of the serpent goddess in the ruins of the Palace
of Knossos. The fact that the Cretans made artificial
cockle-shells is of special interest, especially when we
find that in Egypt the earliest use to which gold was
put was in the manufacture of models of snail-shells in
a necklace.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> In different countries cowrie shells were
similarly imitated in stone, ivory, and metal.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Shells were thought to impart vitality and give
protection, not only to human beings, but even to
the plots of the earliest florists and agriculturists.
"Mary, Mary, quite contrairie", who in the nursery
rhyme has in her garden "cockle-shells all in row",
was perpetuating an ancient custom. The cockle-shell
is still favoured by conservative villagers, and may be
seen in their garden plots and in graveyards. Shells
placed at cottage doors, on window-sills, and round
fire-places are supposed to bring luck and give security,
like the horse-shoe on the door.</p>

<p>The mother goddess, remembered as the fairy queen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
is still connected with shells in Hebridean folk-lore.
A Gaelic poet refers to the goddess as "the maiden
queen of wisdom who dwelt in the beauteous bower
of the single tree where she could see the whole world
and where no fool could see her beauty". She lamented
the lack of wisdom among women, and invited them to
her knoll. When they were assembled there the goddess
appeared, holding in her hand the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">copan Moire</i>
("Cup of Mary"), as the blue-eyed limpet shell is called.
The shell contained "the ais (milk) of wisdom", which
she gave to all who sought it. "Many", we are told,
"came to the knoll too late, and there was no wisdom
left for them."<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> A Gaelic poet says the "maiden
queen" was attired in emerald green, silver, and mother-of-pearl.</p>

<p>Here a particular shell is used by an old goddess for
a specific purpose. She imparts knowledge by providing
a magic drink referred to as "milk". The question
arises, however, if a deity of this kind was known in
early times. Did the Crô-Magnons of the Aurignacian
stage of culture conceive of a god or goddess in human
form who nourished her human children and instructed
them as do human mothers? The figure of a woman,
holding in her hand a horn which appears to have been
used for drinking from, is of special interest in this connection.
As will be shown, the Hebridean "maiden"
links with other milk-providing deities.</p>

<p>The earliest religious writings in the world are the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
Pyramid Texts of ancient Egypt which, as Professor
Breasted so finely says, "vaguely disclose to us a
vanished world of thought and speech". They abound
"in allusions to lost myths, to customs and usages long
since ended". Withal, they reflect the physical conditions
of a particular area&mdash;the Nile Valley, in which
the sun and the river are two outstanding natural
features. There was, however, a special religious reason
for connecting the sun and the river.</p>

<p>In these old Pyramid Texts are survivals from a period
apparently as ancient as that of early Aurignacian civilization
in Europe, and perhaps, as the clue afforded by
the Indian shell found in the Grimaldi cave, not unconnected
with it. The mother goddess, for instance,
is prayed to so that she may suckle the soul of the dead
Pharaoh as a mother suckles her child and never wean
him.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Milk was thus the elixir of life, and as the mother
goddess of Egypt is found to have been identified with the
cowrie&mdash;indeed to have been the spirit or personification
of the shell&mdash;the connection between shells and milk
may have obtained even in Aurignacian times in south-western
Europe. That the mother goddess of Crô-Magnons
had a human form is suggested by the
representations of mothers which have been brought
to light. An Aurignacian statuette of limestone found
in the cave of Willendorf, Lower Austria, has been
called the "Venus of Willendorf". She is very corpulent&mdash;apparently
because she was regarded as a giver
of life. Other statues of like character have been unearthed
near Mentone, and they have a striking resemblance
to the figurines of fat women found in the
pre-dynastic graves of Egypt and in Crete and Malta.
The bas-relief of the fat woman sculptured on a boulder
inside the Aurignacian shelter of Laussel may similarly
have been a goddess. In her right hand she holds a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
bison's horn&mdash;perhaps a drinking horn containing an
elixir. Traces of red colouring remain on the body.
A notable fact about these mysterious female forms is
that the heads are formal, the features being scarcely,
if at all, indicated.</p>

<p>Even if no such "idols" had been found, it does not
follow that the early people had no ideas about supernatural
beings. There are references in Gaelic to the
<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">coich anama</i> (the "spirit case", or "soul shell", or
"soul husk"). In Japan, which has a particularly rich
and voluminous mythology, there are no idols in Shinto
temples. A deity is symbolized by the <i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">shintai</i> (God
body), which may be a mirror, a weapon, or a round
stone, a jewel or a pearl. A pearl is a <i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">tama</i>; so is a
precious stone, a crystal, a bit of worked jade, or a necklace
of jewels, ivory, artificial beads, &amp;c. The soul of
a supernatural being is called <i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">mi-tama&mdash;mi</i> being now
a honorific prefix, but originally signifying a water
serpent (dragon god). The shells, of which ancient
deities were personifications, may well have been to
the Crô-Magnons pretty much what a <i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">tama</i> is to the
Japanese, and what magic crystals were to mediæval
Europeans who used them for magical purposes. It
may have been believed that in the shells, green stones,
and crystals remained the influence of deities as the
power of beasts of prey remained in their teeth and
claws. The ear-rings and other Pagan ornaments
which Jacob buried with Laban's idols under the oak
at Shechem were similarly supposed to be god bodies
or coagulated forms of "life substance". All idols were
temporary or permanent bodies of deities, and idols
were not necessarily large. It would seem to be a
reasonable conclusion that all the so-called ornaments
found in ancient graves were supposed to have had an
intimate connection with the supernatural beings who
gave origin to and sustained life. These ornaments, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
charms, or amulets, imparted vitality to human beings,
because they were regarded as the substance of life
itself. The red jasper worn in the waist girdles of the
ancient Egyptians was reputed, as has been stated, to
be a coagulated drop of the blood of the mother goddess
Isis. Blood was the essence of life.</p>

<p>The red woman or goddess of the Laussel shelter
was probably coloured so as to emphasize her vitalizing
attributes; the red colour animated the image.</p>

<p>An interesting reference in Shakespeare's <cite>Hamlet</cite> to
ancient burial customs may here be quoted, because it
throws light on the problem under discussion. When
Ophelia's body is carried into the graveyard<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> one of
the priests says that as "her death was doubtful" she
should have been buried in "ground unsanctified"&mdash;that
is, among the suicides and murderers. Having
taken her own life, she was unworthy of Christian
burial, and should be buried in accordance with Pagan
customs. In all our old churchyards the takers of life
were interred on the north side, and apparently in
Shakespeare's day traditional Pagan rites were observed
in the burials of those regarded as Pagans. The priest
in <cite>Hamlet</cite>, therefore, says of Ophelia:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">She should in ground unsanctified have lodged</div>
<div class="line">Till the last trumpet; <i>for charitable prayers,</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her</i>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There are no shards (fragments of pottery) in the
Crô-Magnon graves, but flints and pebbles mingle with
shells, teeth, and other charms and amulets. Vast
numbers of perforated shells have been found in the
burial caves near Mentone. In one case the shells are
so numerous that they seem to have formed a sort of
burial mantle. "Similarly," says Professor Osborn,
describing another of these finds, "the female skeleton
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
was enveloped in a bed of shells not perforated; the
legs were extended, while the arms were stretched
beside the body; there were a few pierced shells and
a few bits of silex. One of the large male skeletons
of the same grotto had the lower limbs extended, the
upper limbs folded, and was decorated with a gorget
and crown of perforated shells; the head rested on a
block of red stone." In another case "heavy stones
protected the body from disturbance; the head was
decorated with a circle of perforated shells <i>coloured in
red</i>, and implements of various types were carefully
placed on the forehead and chest". The body of the
Combe-Capelle man "was decorated with a necklace
of perforated shells and surrounded with a great number
of fine Aurignacian flints. It appears", adds Osborn,
"that in all the numerous burials of these grottos of
Aurignacian age and industry of the Crô-Magnon race
we have the burial standards which prevailed in western
Europe at this time."<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>It has been suggested by one of the British archæologists
that the necklaces of perforated cowrie shells and
the red pigment found among the remains of early man
in Britain were used by children. This theory does not
accord with the evidence afforded by the Grimaldi caves,
in which the infant skeletons are neither coloured nor
decorated. Occasionally, however, the children were
interred in burial mantles of small perforated shells,
while female adults were sometimes placed in beds of
unperforated shells. Shells have been found in early
British graves. These include <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nerita litoralis</i>, and even
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Patella vulgata</i>, the common limpet. Holes were rubbed
in them so that they might be strung together. In a
megalithic cist unearthed in Ph&oelig;nix Park, Dublin, in
1838, two male skeletons had each beside them perforated
shells (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nerita litoralis</i>). During the construction of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
the Edinburgh and Granton railway there was found
beside a skeleton in a stone cist a quantity of cockle-shell
rings. Two dozen perforated oyster-shells were
found in a single Orkney cist. Many other examples
of this kind could be referred to.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>In the Crô-Magnon caverns are imprints of human
hands which had been laid on rock and then dusted
round with coloured earth. In a number of cases it is
shown that one or more finger joints of the left hand had
been cut off.</p>

<p>The practice of finger mutilation among Bushman,
Australian, and Red Indian tribes, is associated with
burial customs and the ravages of disease. A Bushman
woman may cut off a joint of one of her fingers when
a near relative is about to die. Red Indians cut off
finger-joints when burying their dead during a pestilence,
so as "to cut off deaths"; they sacrificed a part
of the body to save the whole. In Australia finger
mutilation is occasionally practised. Highland Gaelic
stories tell of heroes who lie asleep to gather power
which will enable them to combat with monsters or
fierce enemies. Heroines awake them by cutting off
a finger joint, a part of the ear, or a portion of skin from
the scalp.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>The colours used in drawings of hands in Palæolithic
caves are black, white, red, and yellow, as the Abbé
Breuil has noted. In Spain and India, the hand prints
are supposed to protect dwellings from evil influences.
Horse-shoes, holly with berries, various plants, shells,
&amp;c, are used for a like purpose among those who in
our native land perpetuate ancient customs.</p>

<p>The Arabs have a custom of suspending figures of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
open hand from the necks of their children, and the
Turks and Moors paint hands upon their ships and
houses, "as an antidote and counter charm to an evil eye;
for five is with them an unlucky number; and 'five
(fingers, perhaps) in your eyes' is their proverb of
cursing and defiance". In Portugal the hand spell is
called the <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">figa</i>. Southey suggests that our common
phrase "a fig for him" was derived from the name of
the Portuguese hand amulet.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>"The figo for thy friendship" is an interesting reference
by Shakespeare.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Fig or figo is probably from
<i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">fico</i>, a snap of the fingers, which in French is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faire la
figue</i>, and in Italian <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">far le fiche</i>. Finger snapping had
no doubt originally a magical significance.</p>

Peoples in Britain.</p>

<p>In late Aurignacian times the influence of a new
industry was felt in Western Europe. It first came from
the south, and reached as far north as England where
it can be traced in the caverns. Then, in time, it spread
westward and wedge-like through Central Europe in full
strength, with the force and thoroughness of an invasion,
reaching the northern fringe of the Spanish coast. This
was the Solutrean industry which had distinctive and
independent features of its own. It was not derived from
Aurignacian but had developed somewhere in Africa&mdash;perhaps
in Somaliland, whence it radiated along the
Libyan coast towards the west and eastward into Asia.
The main or "true" Solutrean influence entered Europe
from the south-east. It did not pass into Italy, which
remained in the Aurignacian stage until Azilian times,
nor did it cross the Pyrenees or invade Spain south of
the Cantabrian Mountains. The earlier "influence" is
referred to as "proto-Solutrean".</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
Solutrean is well represented in Hungary where no
trace of Aurignacian culture has yet been found.
Apparently that part of Europe had offered no attractions
for the Crô-Magnons.</p>

<p>Who the carriers of this new culture were it is as yet
impossible to say with confidence. They may have
been a late "wave" of the same people who had first
introduced Aurignacian culture into Europe, and they
may have been representative of a different race. Some
ethnologists incline to connect the Solutrean culture
with a new people whose presence is indicated by the
skulls found at Brünn and Brüx in Bohemia. These
intruders had lower foreheads than the Crô-Magnons,
narrower and longer faces, and low cheek-bones. It
may be that they represented a variety of the Mediterranean
race. Whoever they were, they did not make
much use of ivory and bone, but they worked flint with
surpassing skill and originality. Their technique was
quite distinct from the Aurignacian. With the aid of
wooden or bone tools, they finished their flint artifacts
by pressure, gave them excellent edges and points, and
shaped them with artistic skill. Their most characteristic
flints are the so-called laurel-leaf (broad) and willow-leaf
(narrow) lances. These were evidently used in the
chase. There is no evidence that they were used in
battle. Withal, their weapons had a religious significance.
Fourteen laurel-leaf spear-heads of Solutrean
type which were found together at Volgu, Saône-et-Loire,
are believed to have been a votive offering to a
deity. At any rate, these were too finely worked and
too fragile, like some of the peculiar Shetland and
Swedish knives of later times, to have been used as
implements. One has retained traces of red colouring.
It may be that the belief enshrined in the Gaelic saying,
"Every weapon has its demon", had already come into
existence. In Crete the double-axe was in Minoan times
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
a symbol of a deity;<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and in northern Egypt and on the
Libyan coast the crossed arrows symbolized the goddess
Neith; while in various countries, and especially in
India, there are ancient stories about the spirits of
weapons appearing in visions and promising to aid
great hunters and warriors. The custom of giving
weapons personal names, which survived for long in
Europe, may have had origin in Solutrean times.</p>

<p>Art languished in Solutrean times. Geometrical
figures were incised on ivory and bone; some engraving
of mammoths, reindeer, and lions have been found
in Moravia and France. When the human figure was
depicted, the female was neglected and studies made of
males. It may be that the Solutreans had a god-cult as
distinguished from the goddess-cult of the Aurignacians,
and that their "flint-god" was an early form of Zeus,
or of Thor, whose earliest hammer was of flint. The
Romans revered "Jupiter Lapis" (silex). When the
solemn oath was taken at the ceremony of treaty-making,
the representative of the Roman people struck a sacrificial
pig with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">silex</i> and said, "Do thou, Diespiter,
strike the Roman people as I strike this pig here to-day,
and strike them the more, as thou art greater and
stronger". Mr. Cyril Bailey (<cite>The Religion of Ancient
Rome</cite>, p. 7) expresses the view that "in origin the stone
is itself the god".</p>

<p>During Solutrean times the climate of Europe,
although still cold, was drier that in Aurignacian times.
It may be that the intruders seized the flint quarries of
the Crô-Magnons, and also disputed with them the
possession of hunting-grounds. The cave art declined
or was suspended during what may have been a military
regime and perhaps, too, under the influence of a new
religion and new social customs. Open-air camps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
beside rock-shelters were greatly favoured. It may
be, as has been suggested, that the Solutreans were as
expert as the modern Eskimos in providing clothing and
skin-tents. Bone needles were numerous. They fed
well, and horse-flesh was a specially favoured food.</p>

<p>In their mountain retreats, the Aurignacians may
have concentrated more attention than they had previously
done on the working of bone and horn; it may
be that they were reinforced by new races from north-eastern
Europe, who had been developing a distinctive
industry on the borders of Asia. At any rate, the industry
known as Magdalenian became widespread when
the ice-fields crept southward again, and southern and
central Europe became as wet and cold as in early
Aurignacian times. Solutrean culture gradually declined
and vanished and Magdalenian became supreme.</p>

<p>The Magdalenian stage of culture shows affinities
with Aurignacian and betrays no influence of Solutrean
technique. The method of working flint was quite different.
The Magdalenians, indeed, appear to have
attached little importance to flint for implements of the
chase. They often chipped it badly in their own way and
sometimes selected flint of poor quality, but they had
beautiful "scrapers" and "gravers" of flint. It does
not follow, however, that they were a people on a lower
stage of culture than the Solutreans. New inventions
had rendered it unnecessary for them to adopt Solutrean
technique. Most effective implements of horn and bone
had come into use and, if wars were waged&mdash;there is no
evidence of warfare&mdash;the Magdalenians were able to
give a good account of themselves with javelins and
exceedingly strong spears which were given a greater
range by the introduction of spear-throwers&mdash;"cases"
from which spears were thrown. The food supply was
increased by a new method of catching fish. Barbed
harpoons of reindeer-horn had been invented, and no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
doubt many salmon, &amp;c., were caught at river-side
stations.</p>

<p>The Crô-Magnons, as has been found, were again in
the ascendant, and their artistic genius was given full
play as in Aurignacian times, and, no doubt, as a result
of the revival of religious beliefs that fostered art as a
cult product. Once again the painters, engravers, and
sculptors adorned the caves with representations of wild
animals. Colours were used with increasing skill and
taste. The artists had palettes on which to mix their
colours, and used stone lamps, specimens of which have
been found, to light up their "studios" in deep cave
recesses. During this Magdalenian stage of culture the
art of the Crô-Magnons reached its highest standard of
excellence, and grew so extraordinarily rich and varied
that it compares well with the later religious arts of
ancient Egypt and Babylonia.</p>

<p>The horse appears to have been domesticated. There
is at Saint Michel d'Arudy a "Celtic" horse depicted
with a bridle, while at La Madeleine was found a "bâton
de commandement" on which a human figure, with a
stave in his right hand, walks past two horses which
betray no signs of alarm.</p>

<p>Our knowledge is scanty regarding the races that
occupied Europe during Magdalenian times. In addition
to the Crô-Magnons there were other distinctive
types. One of these is represented by the Chancelade
skeleton found at Raymonden shelter. Some think it
betrays Eskimo affinities and represents a racial "drift"
from the Russian steppes. In his <cite>Ancient Hunters</cite>
Professor Sollas shows that there are resemblances between
Eskimo and Magdalenian artifacts.</p>

<p>The Magdalenian culture reached England, although
it never penetrated into Italy, and was shut out from the
greater part of Spain. It has been traced as far north
as Derbyshire, on the north-eastern border of which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
Cresswell caves have yielded Magdalenian relics, including
flint-borers, engravers, &amp;c., and bone implements,
including a needle, an awl, chisels, an engraving
of a horse on bone, &amp;c. Kent's Cavern, near Torquay
in Devonshire, has also yielded Magdalenian flints and
implements of bone, including pins, awls, barbed harpoons,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>During early Magdalenian times, however, our native
land did not offer great attractions to Continental people.
The final glacial epoch may have been partial, but it
was severe, and there was a decided lowering of the
temperature. Then came a warmer and drier spell,
which was followed by the sixth partial glaciation.
Thereafter the "great thaw" opened up Europe to the
invasion of new races from Asia and Africa.</p>

<p>Three distinct movements of peoples in Europe can
be traced in post-Magdalenian times, and during what
has been called the "Transition Period", between the
Upper Palæolithic and Lower Neolithic Ages or stages.
The ice-cap retreated finally from the mountains of Scotland
and Sweden, and the reindeer migrated northward.
Magdalenian civilization was gradually broken up, and
the cave art suffered sharp decline until at length it
perished utterly. Trees flourished in areas where
formerly the reindeer scraped the snow to crop moss
and lichen, and rich pastures attracted the northward
migrating red deer, the roe-deer, the ibex, the wild boar,
wild cattle, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The new industries are known as the Tardenoisian,
the Azilian, and the Maglemosian.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Tardenoisian flints are exceedingly small and beautifully
worked, and have geometric forms; they are known
as "microliths" and "pygmy flints". They were
evidently used in catching fish, some being hooks and
others spear-heads; and they represent a culture that
spread round the Mediterranean basin: these flints are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
found in northern Egypt, Tunis, Algeria, and Italy; from
Italy they passed through Europe into England and
Scotland. A people who decorated with scenes of daily
life rock shelters and caves in Spain, and hunted red
deer and other animals with bows and arrows, were
pressing northward across the new grass-lands towards
the old Magdalenian stations. Men wore pants and
feather head-dresses; women had short gowns, blouses,
and caps, as had the late Magdalenians, and both sexes
wore armlets, anklets, and other ornaments of magical
potency. Females were nude when engaged in the
chase. The goddess Diana had evidently her human
prototypes. There were ceremonial dances, as the rock
pictures show; women lamented over graves, and affectionate
couples&mdash;at least they seem to have been affectionate&mdash;walked
hand in hand as they gradually migrated
towards northern Spain, and northern France and Britain.
The horse was domesticated, and is seen being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
led by the halter. Wild animal "drives" were organized,
and many victims fell to archer and spearman.
Arrows were feathered; bows were large and strong.
Symbolic signs indicate that a script similar to those of
the Ægean area, the northern African coast, and pre-dynastic
Egypt was freely used. Drawings became
conventional, and ultimately animals and human beings
were represented by signs. This culture lasted after the
introduction of the Neolithic industry in some areas, and
in others after the bronze industry had been adopted by
sections of the people.</p>

<p>When the Magdalenian harpoon of reindeer horn was
imitated by the flat harpoon of red-deer horn, this new
culture became what is known as Azilian. It met and
mingled with Tardenoisian, which appears to have
arrived later, and the combined industries are referred
to as Azilian-Tardenoisian.</p>

<p>While the race-drifts, represented by the carriers of
the Azilian and Tardenoisian industries, were moving
into France and Britain, another invasion from the East
was in progress. It is represented in the famous Ofnet
cave where long-heads and broad-heads were interred.
The Asiatic Armenoids (Alpine type) had begun to
arrive in Europe, the glaciers having vanished in Asia
Minor. Skulls of broad-heads found in the Belgian cave
of Furfooz, in which sixteen human skeletons were unearthed
in 1867, belong to this period. The early
Armenoids met and mingled with representatives of the
blond northern race, and were the basis of the broad-headed
blonds of Holland, Denmark, and Belgium.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p>EXAMPLES OF PALÆOLITHIC ART</p>

<p>The objects include: handles of knives and daggers carved in ivory and bone, line
drawings of wild animals, faces of masked men, of animal-headed deity or masked man
with arms uplifted (compare Egyptian "Ka" attitude of adoration), of wild horses on
perforated <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bâton de commandement</i>, of man stalking a bison, of seal, cow, reindeer,
cave-bear, &amp;c., and perforated amulets.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Maglemosian culture is believed to have been introduced
by the ancestors of the fair peoples of Northern
Europe. It has been so named after the finds at Maglemose
in the "Great Moor", near Mullerup, on the
western coast of Zeeland. A lake existed at this place
at a time when the Baltic was an inland water completely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
shut off from the North Sea. In a peat bog, formerly
the bed of the lake, were found a large number of flint
and bone artifacts. These included Tardenoisian microliths,
barbed harpoons of bone, needles of bone, spears
of bone, &amp;c. Bone was more freely used than horn for
implements and weapons. The animals hunted included
the stag, roe-deer, moose, wild ox, and wild boar.
Dogs were domesticated. It appears that the Maglemosians
were lake-dwellers. Their houses, however,
had not been erected on stilts, but apparently on a
floating platform of logs, which was no doubt anchored
or moored to the shore. There are traces of Magdalenian
influence in Maglemosian culture. Although many
decorative forms on bone implements and engravings
on rocks are formal and symbolic, there are some fine
and realistic representations of animals worthy of the
Magdalenian cave artists. Traces of the Maglemosian
racial drift have been obtained on both sides of the
Baltic and in the Danish kitchen middens. Engravings
on rocks at Lake Onega in Northern Russia closely
resemble typical Maglemosian work. Apparently the
northern fair peoples entered Europe from Western
Siberia, and in time were influenced by Neolithic culture.
But before the Europeans began to polish their stone
implements and weapons, the blond hunters and fishermen
settled not only in Denmark and Southern Sweden
and Norway but also in Britain.</p>

<p>At the time when the Baltic was an inland fresh-water
lake, the southern part of the North Sea was dry land,
and trees grew on Dogger Bank, from which fishermen
still occasionally lift in their trawls lumps of "moor-log"
(peat) and the bones of animals, including those of the
reindeer, the red deer, the horse, the wild ox, the bison,
the Irish elk, the bear, the wolf, the beaver, the woolly
rhinoceros, the mammoth, and the walrus. No doubt
the Maglemosians found their way over this "land-bridge",
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
crossing the rivers in rude boats, and on foot
when the rivers were frozen. Evidence has been forthcoming
that they also followed the present coast line
towards Boulogne, near which a typical Maglemosian
harpoon has been discovered.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">
<p>A Notable Example of late Magdalenian Culture: engraving on bone of browsing
reindeer. From Kesserloch, Switzerland. (After Heim.)</p>
</div></div>

<p>Traces of Maglemosian influence have been found
as far north as Scotland on the Hebridean islands of
Oronsay and Risga. The MacArthur cave at Oban
reveals Azilian artifacts. In the Victoria cave near
Settle in Yorkshire a late Magdalenian or proto-Azilian
harpoon made of reindeer-horn is of special interest,
displaying, as it does, a close connection between late
Magdalenian and early Azilian. Barbed harpoons,
found at the shelter of Druimvargie, near Oban, are
Azilian, some displaying Maglemosian features. Barbed
harpoons of bone, and especially those with barbs on
one side only, are generally Maglemosian, while those
of horn and double-barbed are typically Azilian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
Apparently the fair Northerners, the carriers of Maglemosian
culture, and the dark Iberians, the carriers of
Azilian culture, met and mingled in Scotland and England
long before the Neolithic industry was introduced.
There were also, it would appear, communities in Britain
of Crô-Magnons, and perhaps of other racial types that
existed on the Continent and in late Magdalenian times.
The fair peoples of England and Wales, Scotland and
Ireland are not therefore all necessarily descendants of
Celts, Angles, Saxons, and Vikings. The pioneer
settlers in the British Isles, in all probability, included
blue and grey-eyed and fair or reddish-haired peoples
who in Scotland may have formed the basis of the later
Caledonian type, compared by Tacitus to the Germans,
but bearing an undoubted Celtic racial name, the military
aristocrats being Celts.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<small>The Faithful Dog</small></h2>

<p class="blockquote">Transition Period between Palæolithic and Neolithic Ages&mdash;Theory
of the Neolithic Edge&mdash;Crô-Magnon Civilization was broken up by Users
of Bow and Arrow&mdash;Domesticated Dog of Fair Northerners&mdash;Dogs as
Guides and Protectors of Man&mdash;The Dog in Early Religion&mdash;Dog Guides
of Souls&mdash;The Dog of Hades&mdash;Dogs and Death&mdash;The Scape-dog in Scotland&mdash;Souls
in Dog Form&mdash;Traces of Early Domesticated Dogs&mdash;Romans
imported British Dogs.</p>

<p>The period we have now reached is regarded by some
as that of transition between the Palæolithic and Neolithic
Ages, and by others as the Early Neolithic period.
It is necessary, therefore, that we should keep in mind
that these terms have been to a great extent divested of
the significance originally attached to them. The transition
period was a lengthy one, extending over many
centuries during which great changes occurred. It was
much longer than the so-called "Neolithic Age". New
races appeared in Europe and introduced new habits of
life and thought, new animals appeared and animals
formerly hunted by man retreated northward or became
extinct; the land sank and rose; a great part of the
North Sea and the English Channel was for a time dry
land, and trees grew on the plateau now marked by the
Dogger Bank during this "Transition Period", and
before it had ended the Strait of Dover had widened
and England was completely cut off from the Continent.</p>

<p>Compared with these great changes the invention of
the polished axe edge seems almost trivial. Yet some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
writers have regarded this change as being all-important.
"On the edge ever since its discovery", writes one of
them with enthusiasm, "has depended and probably
will depend to the end of time the whole artistic and
artificial environment of human existence, in all its
infinite varied complexity.... By this discovery was
broken down a wall that for untold ages had dammed
up a stagnant, unprogressive past, and through the
breach were let loose all the potentialities of the future
civilization of mankind. It was entirely due to the discovery
of the edge that man was enabled, in the course
of time, to invent the art of shipbuilding."<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>This is a very sweeping claim and hardly justified by
the evidence that of late years has come to light. Much
progress had been achieved before the easy method of
polishing supplanted that of secondary working. The
so-called Palæolithic implements were not devoid of
edges. What really happened was that flint-working
was greatly simplified. The discovery was an important
one, but it was not due to it alone that great changes
in habits of life were introduced. Long before the introduction
of the Neolithic industry, the earliest traces
of which in Western Europe have been obtained at
Campigny near the village of Blangy on the River
Bresle, the Magdalenian civilization of the Crô-Magnons
had been broken up by the Azilian-Tardenoisian intruders
in Central and Western Europe and by the
Maglemosians in the Baltic area.</p>

<p>The invading hordes in Spain, so far as can be
gathered from rock pictures, made more use of bows
and arrows than of spears, and it may be that their social
organization was superior to that of the Magdalenians.
Their animal "drives" suggest as much. It may be
that they were better equipped for organized warfare&mdash;if
there was warfare&mdash;and for hunting by organizing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
drives than the taller and stronger Crô-Magnons.
When they reached the Magdalenian stations they
adopted the barbed harpoon, imitating reindeer-horn
forms in red-deer horn.</p>

<p>The blond Maglemosians in the Baltic area introduced
from Asia the domesticated dog. They were thus able
to obtain their food supply with greater ease than did
the Solutreans with their laurel-leaf lances, or the Magdalenians
with their spears tipped with bone or horn.
When man was joined by his faithful ally he met with
more success than when he pursued the chase unaided.
Withal, he could take greater risks when threatened by
the angry bulls of a herd, and operate over more extended
tracks of country with less fear of attack by beasts of
prey. His dogs warned him of approaching peril and
guarded his camp by night.</p>

<p>Hunters who dwelt in caves may have done so partly
for protection against lions and bears and wolves that
were attracted to hunters' camps by the scent of flesh
and blood. No doubt barriers had to be erected to
shield men, women, and children in the darkness; and
it may be that there were fires and sentinels at cave
entrances.</p>

<p>The introduction of the domesticated dog may have
influenced the development of religious beliefs. Crô-Magnon
hunters appear to have performed ceremonies
in the depths of caverns where they painted and carved
wild animals, with purpose to obtain power over them.
Their masked dances, in which men and women represented
wild animals, chiefly beasts of prey, may have
had a similar significance. The fact that, during the
Transition Period, a cult art passed out of existence, and
the caves were no longer centres of culture and political
power, may have been directly or indirectly due to the
domestication of the dog and the supremacy achieved by
the intruders who possessed it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
There can be no doubt that the dog played its part in
the development of civilization. As much is suggested
by the lore attaching to this animal. It occupies a
prominent place in mythology. The dog which guided
and protected the hunter in his wanderings was supposed
to guide his soul to the other world.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">He thought admitted to that equal sky,</div>
<div class="line">His faithful dog would bear him company.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In Ancient Egypt the dog-headed god Anubis was the
guide and protector of souls. Apuatua, an early form
of Osiris, was a dog god. Yama, the Hindu god of
death, as Dharma, god of justice, assumed his dog form
to guide the Panadava brothers to Paradise, as is related
in the Sanskrit epic the <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Mahá-bhárata</i><a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>. The god Indra,
the Hindu Jupiter, was the "big dog", and the custom
still prevails among primitive Indian peoples of torturing
a dog by pouring hot oil into its ears so that the "big
dog" may hear and send rain. In the <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Mahá-bhárata</i>
there is a story about Indra appearing as a hunter followed
by a pack of dogs. As the "Wild Huntsman"
the Scandinavian god Odin rides through the air followed
by dogs. The dog is in Greek mythology the
sentinel of Hades; it figures in a like capacity in the
Hades of Northern Mythology. Cuchullin, the Gaelic
hero, kills the dog of Hades and takes its place until
another dog is found and trained, and that is why he is
called "Cu" (the dog) of Culann. A pool in Kildonan,
Sutherland, which was reputed to contain a pot of gold,
was supposed to be guarded by a big black dog with
two heads. A similar legend attaches to Hound's Pool
in the parish of Dean Combe, Devonshire. In different
parts of the world the dog is the creator and ancestor of
the human race, the symbol of kinship, &amp;c. The star
Sirius was associated with the dog. In Scotland and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Ireland "dog stones" were venerated. A common surviving
belief is that dogs howl by night when a sudden
death is about to occur. This association of the dog
with death is echoed by Theocritus. "Hark!" cries
Simaetha, "the dogs are barking through the town.
Hecate is at the crossways. Haste, clash the brazen
cymbals." The dog-god of Scotland is remembered as
<i>an cù sìth</i> ("the supernatural dog"); it is as big as
a calf, and by night passes rapidly over land and sea.
A black demon-dog&mdash;the "Moddey Dhoo"&mdash;referred to
by Scott in <cite>Peveril of the Peak</cite> was supposed to haunt Peel
Castle in the Isle of Man. A former New Year's day
custom in Perthshire was to send away from a house
door a scape-dog with the words, "Get away you dog!
Whatever death of men or loss of cattle would happen
in this house till the end of the present year, may it all
light on your head." A similar custom obtained among
Western Himalayan peoples. Early man appears to
have regarded his faithful companion as a supernatural
being. There are Gaelic references to souls appearing
in dog form to assist families in time of need. Not only
did the dog attack beasts of prey; in Gaelic folk-tales it
is the enemy of fairies and demons, and especially cave-haunting
demons. Early man's gratitude to and dependence
on the dog seems to be reflected in stories of this
kind.</p>

<p>When the Baltic peoples, who are believed to be the
first "wave" of blond Northerners, moved westward towards
Denmark during the period of the "great thaw",
they must have been greatly assisted by the domesticated
dog, traces of which are found in Maglemosian stations.
Bones of dogs have been found in the Danish kitchen
middens and in the MacArthur cave at Oban. It may
be that the famous breed of British hunting dogs which
were in Roman times exported to Italy were descended
from those introduced by the Maglemosian hunters.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
Seven Irish dogs were in the fourth century presented
to Symmachus, a Roman consul, by his brother. "All
Rome", the grateful recipient wrote, "view them with
wonder and thought they must have been brought hither
in iron cages."</p>

<p>Great dogs were kept in Ancient Britain and Ireland
for protection against wolves as well as for hunting wild
animals. The ancient Irish made free use in battle of
large fierce hounds. In the folk-stories of Scotland dogs
help human beings to attack and overcome supernatural
beings. Dogs were the enemies of the fairies, mermaids,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>Dog gods figure on the ancient sculptured stones of
Scotland. The names of the Irish heroes Cuchullin
and Con-chobar were derived from those of dog deities.
"Con" is the genitive of "Cu" (dog).</p>

<p>The Maglemosian (Baltic) and Azilian (Iberian) peoples,
who reached and settled in Britain long before the introduction
of the Neolithic industry, appear, as has been
shown, to have crossed the great land-bridge, which is
now marked by the Dogger Bank, and the narrowed
land-bridge that connected England and France. No
doubt they came at first in small bands, wandering along
the river banks and founding fishing communities, following
the herds of red deer and wild cows that had
moved northward, and seeking flints, &amp;c. The Crô-Magnons,
whose civilization the new intruders had
broken up on the Continent, were already in Britain,
where the reindeer lingered for many centuries after
they had vanished from France. The reindeer moss
still grows in the north of Scotland. Bones and horns
of the reindeer have been found in this area in association
with human remains as late as of the Roman period.
In the twelfth century the Norsemen hunted reindeer in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Caithness.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Cæsar refers to the reindeer in the Hercynian
forest of Germany (<cite>Gallic War</cite>, VI, 26).</p>

<p>The early colonists of fair Northerners who introduced
the Maglemosian culture into Britain from the Baltic
area could not have crossed the North Sea land-bridge
without the aid of rafts or boats. Great broad rivers
were flowing towards the north. The Elbe and the
Weser joined one another near the island of Heligoland,
and received tributaries from marshy valleys until a long
estuary wider than is the Wash at present was formed.
Another long river flowed northward from the valley of
the Zuyder Zee, the mouth of which has been traced on
the north-east of the Dogger Bank. The Rhine reached
the North Sea on the south-west of the Dogger Bank,
off Flamborough Head; its tributaries included the
Meuse and the Thames. The Humber and the rivers
flowing at present into the Wash were united before
entering the North Sea between the mouth of the Rhine
and the coast of East Riding.</p>

<p>The Dogger Bank was then a plateau. Trawlers, as
has been stated, sometimes lift from its surface in their
trawl nets lumps of peat, which they call "moor-log",
and also the bones of wild animals, including the wild
ox, the wild horse, red deer, reindeer, the elk, the bear,
the wolf, the hyæna, the beaver, the walrus, the woolly
rhinoceros, and the hairy mammoth. In the peat have
been found the remains of the white birch, the hazel,
sallow, and willow, seeds of bog-bean, fragments of fern,
&amp;c. All the plants have a northern range. In some
pieces of peat have been found plants and insects that
still flourish in Britain.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>The easiest crossing to Britain was over the English
Channel land-bridge. It was ultimately cut through by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
the English Channel river, so that the dark Azilian-Tardenoisian
peoples from Central and Western Europe
and the fair Maglemosians must have required and used
rafts or boats before polished implements of Neolithic
type came into use. In time the North Sea broke
through the marshes of the river land to the east of the
Thames Estuary and joined the waters of the English
Channel. The Strait of Dover was then formed. At
first it may have been narrow enough for animals to
swim across or, at any rate, for the rude river boats or
rafts of the early colonists to be paddled over in safety
between tides. Gradually, however, the strait grew
wider and wider; the chalk cliffs, long undermined by
boring molluscs and scouring shingle, were torn down
by great billows during winter storms.</p>

<p>It may be that for a long period after the North Sea
and English Channel were united, the Dogger Bank
remained an island, and that there were other islands
between Heligoland and the English coast. Pliny, who
had served with the Roman army in Germany, writing
in the first century of our era, refers to twenty-three
islands between the Texel and the Eider in Schleswig-Holstein.
Seven of these have since vanished. The
west coast of Schleswig has, during the past eighteen
hundred years, suffered greatly from erosion, and alluvial
plains that formerly yielded rich harvests are now represented
by sandbanks. The Goodwin Sands, which
stretch for about ten miles off the Kentish coast, were
once part of the fertile estate of Earl Godwin which was
destroyed and engulfed by a great storm towards the
end of the eleventh century. The Gulf of Zuyder Zee
was formerly a green plain with many towns and villages.
Periodic inundations since the Roman period have destroyed
flourishing Dutch farms and villages and eaten
far into the land. There are records of storm-floods that
drowned on one occasion 20,000, and on another no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
fewer than 100,000 inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> It is believed that large
tracts of land, the remnants of the ancient North Sea
land-bridge, have been engulfed since about 3000 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
as a result not merely of erosion but the gradual submergence
of the land. This date is suggested by Mr.
Clement Reid.</p>

<p>"The estimate", he says, "may have to be modified
as we obtain better evidence; but it is as well to realize
clearly that we are not dealing with a long period of
great geological antiquity; we are dealing with times
when the Egyptian, Babylonian, and Minoan (Cretan)
civilizations flourished. Northern Europe was then
probably barbarous, and metals had not come into use;<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
but the amber trade of the Baltic was probably in full
swing. Rumours of any great disaster, such as the
submergence of thousands of square miles and the displacement
of large populations, might spread far and
wide along the trade routes." It may be that the legend
of the Lost Atlantis was founded on reports of such a
disaster, that must have occurred when areas like the
Dogger Bank were engulfed. It may be too that the
gradual wasting away of lands that have long since
vanished propelled migrations of peoples towards the
smiling coasts of England. According to Ammianus
the Druids stated that some of the inhabitants of Gaul
were descendants of refugees from sea-invaded areas.</p>

<p>The gradual sinking of the land and the process of
coast erosion has greatly altered the geography of England.
The beach on which Julius Cæsar landed has
long since vanished, the dwellings of the ancient Azilian
and Maglemosian colonists, who reached England in
post-Glacial times, have been sunk below the English
Channel. When Tilbury Docks were being excavated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
Roman remains were found embedded in clay several
feet below high-water mark. Below several layers of
peat and mud, and immediately under a bank of sand
in which were fragments of decomposed wood, was
found the human skeleton known as "Tilbury man".
The land in this area was originally 80 feet above its
present level.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> But while England was sinking Scotland
was rising. The MacArthur cave at Oban, in
which Azilian hunters and fishermen made their home
on the sea-beach, is now about 30 feet above the old
sea-level.</p>

<p>Before Dover Strait had been widened by the gradual
sinking of the land and the process of coast erosion, and
before the great islands had vanished from the southern
part of the North Sea, the early hunters and fishermen
could have experienced no great difficulty in reaching
England. It is possible that the Azilian, Tardenoisian,
and Maglemosian peoples had made considerable progress
in the art of navigation. Traces of the Tardenoisian
industry have been obtained in Northern Egypt,
along the ancient Libyan coast of North Africa where a
great deal of land has been submerged, and especially
at Tunis, and in Algiers, in Italy, and in England and
Scotland, as has been noted. There were boats on the
Mediterranean at a very early period. The island of
Crete was reached long before the introduction of copper-working
by seafarers who visited the island of Melos,
and there obtained obsidian (natural glass) from which
sharp implements were fashioned. Egyptian mariners,
who dwelt on the Delta coast, imported cedar, not only
from Lebanon but from Morocco, as has been found
from the evidence afforded by mummies packed with the
sawdust of cedar from the Atlas Mountains.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> When
this trade with Morocco began it is impossible to say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
with certainty. Long before 3000 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, however, the
Egyptians were building boats that were fitted with
masts and sails. The ancient mariners were active as
explorers and traders before implements of copper came
into use.</p>

<p>Here we touch on a very interesting problem. Where
were boats first invented and the art of navigation developed?
Rafts and floats formed by tying together two
trees or, as in Egypt, two bundles of reeds, were in use
at a very early period in various countries. In Babylonia
the "kufa", a great floating basket made watertight
with pitch or covered with skins, was an early
invention. It was used as it still is for river ferry boats.
But ships were not developed from "kufas". The dug-out
canoe is one of the early prototypes of the modern
ocean-going vessel. It reached this country before the
Neolithic industry was introduced, and during that
period when England was slowly sinking and Scotland
was gradually rising. Dug-out canoes continued to
come during the so-called "Neolithic" stage of culture
ere yet the sinking and rising of land had ceased.
"That Neolithic man lived in Scotland during the
formation of this beach (the 45-to 50-foot beach) is
proved", wrote the late Professor James Geikie, "by
the frequent occurrence in it of his relics. At Perth, for
example, a dug-out canoe of pine was met with towards
the bottom of the carse clays; and similar finds have
frequently been recorded from the contemporaneous
deposits in the valleys of the Forth and the Clyde."<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>How did early man come to invent the dug-out? Not
only did he hollow out a tree trunk by the laborious process
of burning and by chipping with a flint adze, he
dressed the trunk so that his boat could be balanced on
the water. The early shipbuilders had to learn, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
did learn, for themselves, "the values of length and
beam, of draught and sweet lines, of straight keel; with
high stem to breast a wave and high stern to repel
a following sea". The fashioning of a sea-worthy, or
even a river-worthy boat, must have been in ancient
times as difficult a task as was the fashioning of the first
aeroplane in our own day. Many problems had to be
solved, many experiments had to be made, and, no
doubt, many tragedies took place before the first safe
model-boat was paddled across a river. The early
experimenters may have had shapes of vessels suggested
to them by fish and birds, and especially by the aquatic
birds that paddled past them on the river breast with
dignity and ease. But is it probable that the first
experiments were made with trees? Did early man
undertake the laborious task of hewing down tree after
tree to shape new models, until in the end he found on
launching the correctly shaped vessel that its balance
was perfect? Or was the dug-out canoe an imitation of
a boat already in existence, just as a modern ship built
of steel or concrete is an imitation of the earlier wooden
ships? The available evidence regarding this important
phase of the shipping problem tends to show that, before
the dug-out was invented, boats were constructed of
light material. Ancient Egypt was the earliest shipbuilding
country in the world, and all ancient ships were
modelled on those that traded on the calm waters of the
Nile. Yet Egypt is an almost treeless land. There the
earliest boats&mdash;broad, light skiffs&mdash;were made by binding
together long bundles of the reeds of papyrus.
Ropes were twisted from papyrus as well as from palm
fibre.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> It would appear that, before dug-outs were made,
the problems of boat construction were solved by those
who had invented papyri skiffs and skin boats. In the
case of the latter the skins were stretched round a framework,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
sewed together and made watertight with pitch.
We still refer to the "seams" and the "skin" of a boat.</p>

<p>The art of boat-building spread far and wide from the
area of origin. Until recently the Chinese were building
junks of the same type as they did four or five hundred
years earlier. These junks have been compared by
more than one writer to the deep-sea boats of the
Egyptian Empire period. The Papuans make "dug-outs"
and carve eyes on the prows as did the ancient
Egyptians and as do the Maltese, Chinese, &amp;c., in our
own day. Even when only partly hollowed, the
Papuan boats have perfect balance in the water as soon
as they are launched.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> The Polynesians performed
religious ceremonies when cutting down trees and constructing
boats.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> In their incantations, &amp;c., the lore of
boat-building was enshrined and handed down. The
Polynesian boat was dedicated to the <i>mo-o</i> (dragon-god).
We still retain a relic of an ancient religious ceremony
when a bottle of wine is broken on the bows of a vessel
just as it is being launched.</p>

<p>After the Egyptians were able to secure supplies of
cedar wood from the Atlas Mountains or Lebanon, by
drifting rafts of lashed trees along the coast line, they
made dug-out vessels of various shapes, as can be seen
in the tomb pictures of the Old Kingdom period. These
dug-outs were apparently modelled on the earlier papyri
and skin boats. A ship with a square sail spread to the
wind is depicted on an Ancient Egyptian two-handed
jar in the British Museum, which is of pre-dynastic age
and may date to anything like 4000 or 5000 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> At
that remote period the art of navigation was already well
advanced, no doubt on account of the experience gained
on the calm waters of the Nile.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The existence of these boats on the Nile at a time
when great race migrations were in progress may well
account for the early appearance of dug-outs in Northern
Europe. One of the Clyde canoes, found embedded in
Clyde silt twenty-five feet above the present sea-level,
was found to have a plug of cork which could only have
come from the area in which cork trees grow&mdash;Spain,
Southern France, or Italy.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> It may have been manned
by the Azilians of Spain whose rock paintings date from
the Transition period. Similar striking evidence of the
drift of culture from the Mediterranean area towards
Northern Europe is obtained from some of the rock
paintings and carvings of Sweden. Among the canoes
depicted are some with distinct Mediterranean characteristics.
One at Tegneby in Bohuslän bears a striking
resemblance to a boat seen by Sir Henry Stanley on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
Lake Victoria Nyanza. It seems undoubted that the
designs are of common origin, although separated not
only by centuries but by barriers of mountain, desert, and
sea extending many hundreds of miles. From the
Maglemosian boat the Viking ship was ultimately
developed; the unprogressive Victoria Nyanza boatbuilders
continued through the Ages repeating the
design adopted by their remote ancestors. In both
vessels the keel projects forward, and the figure-head is
that of a goat or ram. The northern vessel has the
characteristic inward curving stern of ancient Egyptian
ships. As the rock on which it was carved is situated
in a metal-yielding area, the probability is that this type
of vessel is a relic of the visits paid by searchers for
metals in ancient times, who established colonies of
dark miners among the fair Northerners and introduced
the elements of southern culture.</p>

<p>The ancient boats found in Scotland are of a variety
of types. One of those at Glasgow lay, when discovered,
nearly vertical, with prow uppermost as if it had foundered;
it had been built "of several pieces of oak, though without
ribs". Another had the remains of an outrigger
attached to it: beside another, which had been partly
hollowed by fire, lay two planks that appear to have
been wash-boards like those on a Sussex dug-out. A
Clyde clinker-built boat, eighteen feet long, had a keel
and a base of oak to which ribs had been attached. An
interesting find at Kinaven in Aberdeenshire, several
miles distant from the Ythan, a famous pearling river,
was a dug-out eleven feet long, and about four feet
broad. It lay embedded at the head of a small ravine
in five feet of peat which appears to have been the bed
of an ancient lake. Near it were the stumps of big oaks,
apparently of the Upper Forestian period.</p>

<p>Among the longest of the ancient boats that have been
discovered are one forty-two feet long, with an animal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
head on the prow, from Loch Arthur, near Dumfries,
one thirty-five long from near the River Arun in Sussex,
one sixty-three feet long excavated near the Rother in
Kent, one forty-eight feet six inches long, found at
Brigg, Lincolnshire, with wooden patches where she had
sprung a leak, and signs of the caulking of cracks and
small holes with moss.</p>

<p>These vessels do not all belong to the same period.
The date of the Brigg boat is, judging from the geological
strata, between 1100 and 700 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> It would
appear that some of the Clyde vessels found at twenty-five
feet above the present sea-level are even older.
Beside one Clyde boat was found an axe of polished
green-stone similar to the axes used by Polynesians and
others in shaping dug-outs. This axe may, however,
have been a religious object. To the low bases of some
vessels were fixed ribs on which skins were stretched.
These boats were eminently suitable for rough seas,
being more buoyant than dug-outs. According to
Himilco the inhabitants of the &OElig;strymnides, the islands
"rich in tin and lead", had most sea-worthy skiffs.
"These people do not make pine keels, nor", he says,
"do they know how to fashion them; nor do they make
fir barks, but, with wonderful skill, fashion skiffs with
sewn skins. In these hide-bound vessels, they skim
across the ocean." Apparently they were as daring
mariners as the Oregon Islanders of whom Washington
Irving has written:</p>

<p class="blockquote">"It is surprising to see with what fearless unconcern these
savages venture in their light barks upon the roughest and
most tempestuous seas. They seem to ride upon the wave
like sea-fowl. Should a surge throw the canoe upon its side,
and endanger its over turn, those to the windward lean over
the upper gunwale, thrust their paddles deep into the wave,
and by this action not merely regain an equilibrium, but give
their bark a vigorous impulse forward."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
The ancient mariners whose rude vessels have been
excavated around our coasts were the forerunners of the
Celtic sea-traders, who, as the Gaelic evidence shows,
had names not only for the North Sea and the English
Channel but also for the Mediterranean Sea. They
cultivated what is known as the "sea sense", and developed
shipbuilding and the art of navigation in accordance
with local needs. When Julius Cæsar came into
conflict with the Veneti of Brittany he tells that their
vessels were greatly superior to those of the Romans.
"The bodies of the ships", he says, "were built entirely
of oak, stout enough to withstand any shock or
violence.... Instead of cables for their anchors they
used iron chains.... The encounter of our fleet with
these ships was of such a nature that our fleet excelled
in speed alone, and the plying of oars; for neither could
our ships injure theirs with their rams, so great was
their strength, nor was a weapon easily cast up to them
owing to their height.... About 220 of their ships ...
sailed forth from the harbour." In this great allied fleet
were vessels from our own country.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>It must not be imagined that the "sea sense" was
cultivated because man took pleasure in risking the
perils of the deep. It was stern necessity that at the
beginning compelled him to venture on long voyages.
After England was cut off from France the peoples who
had adopted the Neolithic industry must have either
found it absolutely necessary to seek refuge in Britain,
or were attracted towards it by reports of prospectors
who found it to be suitable for residence and trade.</p>

<p>The "drift" of peoples into Britain which began in
Aurignacian times continued until the Roman period.
There were definite reasons for early intrusions as there
were for the Roman invasion. "Britain contains to
reward the conqueror", Tacitus wrote,<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> "mines of gold
and silver and other metals. The sea produces pearls."
According to Suetonius, who at the end of the first
century of our era wrote the <cite>Lives of the Cæsars</cite>, Julius
Cæsar invaded Britain with the desire to enrich himself
with the pearls found on different parts of the coast.
On his return to Rome he presented a corselet of British
pearls to the goddess Venus. He was in need of money
to further his political ambitions. He found what he
required elsewhere, however. After the death of Queen
Cleopatra sufficient gold and silver flowed to Rome
from Egypt to reduce the loan rate of interest from 12
to 4 per cent. Spain likewise contributed its share to
enrich the great predatory state of Rome.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Long ages before the Roman period the early peoples
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
entered Britain in search of pearls, precious stones, and
precious metals because these had a religious value.
The Celts of Gaul offered great quantities of gold to
their deities, depositing the precious metals in their
temples and in their sacred lakes. Poseidonius of
Apamea tells that after conquering Gaul "the Romans
put up these sacred lakes to public sale, and many of
the purchasers found quantities of solid silver in them".
He also says that gold was similarly placed in these
lakes.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Apparently the Celts believed, as did the Aryo-Indians,
that gold was "a form of the gods" and "fire,
light, and immortality", and that it was a "life giver".<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
Personal ornaments continued to have a religious value
until Christian times.</p>

<p>CHIPPED AND POLISHED ARTIFACTS FROM SOUTHERN
ENGLAND (British Museum)</p>
</div></div>

<p>As we have seen when dealing with the "Red Man
of Paviland", the earliest ornaments were shells, teeth
of wild animals, coloured stones, ivory, &amp;c. Shells
were carried great distances. Then arose the habit of
producing substitutes which were regarded as of great
potency as the originals. The ancient Egyptians made
use of gold to manufacture imitation shells, and before
they worked copper they wore charms of malachite,
which is an ore of copper. They probably used copper
first for magical purposes just as they used gold. Pearls
found in shells were regarded as depositories of supernatural
influence, and so were coral and amber (see
<a href="#Page_157">Chapter XIII</a>). Like the Aryo-Indians, the Egyptians,
Ph&oelig;nicians, Greeks, and others connected precious
metals, stones, pearls, &amp;c., with their deities, and believed
that these contained the influence of their deities,
and were therefore "lucky". These and similar beliefs
are of great antiquity in Europe and Asia and North
Africa. It would be rash to assume that they were not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
known to the ancient mariners who reached our shores
in vessels of Mediterranean type.</p>

<p>The colonists who were attracted to Britain at various
periods settled in those districts most suitable for their
modes of life. It was necessary that they should obtain
an adequate supply of the materials from which their
implements and weapons were manufactured. The distribution
of the population must have been determined
by the resources of the various districts.</p>

<p>At the present day the population of Britain is most
dense in those areas in which coal and iron are found
and where commerce is concentrated. In ancient times,
before metals were used, it must have been densest in
those areas where flint was found&mdash;that is, on the upper
chalk formations. If worked flints are discovered in
areas which do not have deposits of flint, the only conclusion
that can be drawn is that the flint was obtained
by means of trade, just as Mediterranean shells were in
Aurignacian and Magdalenian times obtained by hunters
who settled in Central Europe. In Devon and Cornwall,
for instance, large numbers of flint implements have
been found, yet in these counties suitable flint was
exceedingly scarce in ancient times, except in East
Devon, where, however, the surface flint is of inferior
character. In Wilts and Dorset, however, the finest
quality of flint was found, and it was no doubt from
these areas that the early settlers in Cornwall and Devon
received their chief supplies of the raw material, if not of
the manufactured articles.</p>

<p>In England, as on the Continent, the most abundant
finds of the earliest flint implements have been made in
those areas where the early hunters and fishermen could
obtain their raw materials. River drift implements are
discovered in largest numbers on the chalk formations
of south-eastern England between the Wash and the
estuary of the Thames.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
The Neolithic peoples, who made less use of horn and
bone than did the Azilians and Maglemosians, had
many village settlements on the upper chalk in Dorset
and Wiltshire, and especially at Avebury where there
were veritable flint factories, and near the famous flint
mines at Grimes Graves in the vicinity of Weeting in
Norfolk and at Cissbury Camp not far from Worthing
in Sussex. Implements were likewise made of basic
rocks, including quartzite, ironstone, green-stone, hornblende
schist, granite, mica-schist, &amp;c.; while ornaments
were made of jet, a hydrocarbon compound allied to
cannel coal, which takes on a fine polish, Kimeridge
shale and ivory. Withal, like the Aurignacians and
Magdalenians, the Neolithic-industry people used body
paint, which was made with pigments of ochre, hæmatite,
an ore of iron, and ruddle, an earthy variety of
iron ore.</p>

<p>In those districts, where the raw materials for stone
implements, ornaments, and body paint were found,
traces survive of the activities of the Neolithic peoples.
Their graves of long-barrow type are found not only in
the chalk areas but on the margins of the lias formations.
Hæmatite is found in large quantities in West Cumberland
and north Lancashire and in south-western England,
while the chief source of jet is Whitby in Yorkshire,
where it occurs in large quantities in beds of the Upper
Lias shale.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_110.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Mr. W. J. Perry, of Manchester University, who has
devoted special attention to the study of the distribution
of megalithic monuments, has been drawing attention
to the interesting association of these monuments with
geological formations.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> In the Avebury district stone
circles, dolmens, chambered barrows, long barrows, and
Neolithic settlements are numerous; another group of
megalithic monuments occurs in Oxford on the margin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
of the lias formation, and at the south-end of the great
iron field extending as far as the Clevelands. According
to the memoir of the geological survey, there are
traces of ancient surface iron-workings in the Middle
Lias formation of Oxfordshire, where red and brown
hæmatite were found. Mr. Perry notes that there are
megalithic monuments in the vicinity of all these surface
workings, as at Fawler, Adderbury, Hook Norton,
Woodstock, Steeple Aston, and Hanbury. Apparently
the Neolithic peoples were attracted to the lias formation
because it contains hæmatite, ochre, shale, &amp;c. There
are significant megaliths in the Whitby region where
the jet is so plentiful. Amber was obtained from the
east coast of England and from the Baltic.</p>

<p>The Neolithic peoples appear to have searched for
pearls, which are found in a number of English, Welsh,
Scottish, and Irish rivers, and in the vicinity of most, if
not all, of these megaliths occur. Gold was the first
metal worked by man, and it appears to have attracted
some of the early peoples who settled in Britain. The
ancient seafarers who found their way northward may
have included searchers for gold and silver. The latter
metal was at one time found in great abundance in
Spain, while gold was at one time fairly plentiful in
south-western England, in North Wales, in various
parts of Scotland and especially in Lanarkshire, and in
north-eastern, eastern, and western Ireland. That there
was a "drift" of civilized peoples into Britain and
Ireland during the period of the Neolithic industry is
made evident by the fact that the agricultural mode of life
was introduced. Barley does not grow wild in Europe.
The nearest area in which it grew wild and was earliest
cultivated was the delta area of Egypt, the region from
which the earliest vessels set out to explore the shores of
the Mediterranean. It may be that the barley seeds
were carried to Britain not by the overland routes alone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
to Channel ports, but also by the seafarers whose boats,
like the Glasgow one with the cork plug, coasted round
by Spain and Brittany, and crossed the Channel to south-western
England and thence went northward to Scotland.
As Irish flints and ground axe-heads occur chiefly
in Ulster, it may be that the drift of early Neolithic
settlers into County Antrim, in which gold was also
found, was from south-western Scotland. The Neolithic
settlement at Whitepark Bay, five miles from the Giant's
Causeway, was embedded at a considerable depth, showing
that there has been a sinking of the land in this area
since the Neolithic industry was introduced.</p>

<p>Neolithic remains are widely distributed over Scotland,
but these have not received the intensive study
devoted to similar relics in England. Mr. Ludovic
Mann, the Glasgow archæologist, has, however, compiled
interesting data regarding one of the local industries
that bring out the resource and activities of early
man. On the island of Arran is a workable variety of
the natural volcanic glass, called pitch-stone, that of
other parts of Scotland and of Ireland being "too much
cracked into small pieces to be of use". It was used by
the Neolithic settlers in Arran for manufacturing arrowheads,
and as it was imported into Bute, Ayrshire, and
Wigtownshire, a trade in this material must have existed.
"If", writes Mr. Mann, "the stone was not locally
worked up into implements in Bute, it was so manipulated
on the mainland, where workshops of the Neolithic
period and the immediately succeeding overlap period
yielded long fine flakes, testifying to greater expertness
in manufacturing there than is shown by the remains in
the domestic sites yet awaiting adequate exploration in
Arran. The explanation may be that the Wigtownshire
flint knappers, accustomed to handle an abundance of
flint, were more proficient than in most other places, and
that the pitch-stone was brought to them as experts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
because the material required even more skilful handling
than flint".<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> In like manner obsidian, as has been
noted, was imported into Crete from the island of Melos
by seafarers, long before the introduction of metal
working.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>It will be seen that the Neolithic peoples were no
mere wandering hunters, as some have represented
them to have been, but they had their social organization,
their industries, and their system of trading by
land and sea. They settled not only in those areas
where they could procure a regular food supply, but
those also in which they obtained the raw materials for
implements, weapons, and the colouring material which
they used for religious purposes. They made pottery
for grave offerings and domestic use, and wooden implements
regarding which, however, little is known.
Withal, they had their spinners and weavers. The
conditions prevailing in Neolithic settlements must have
been similar to those of later times. There must have
been systems of laws to make trade and peaceful social
intercourse possible, and no doubt these had, as elsewhere,
a religious basis. Burial customs indicate a
uniformity of beliefs over wide areas. The skill displayed
in working stone was so great that it cannot now
be emulated. Ripple-flaking has long been a lost art.
Craftsmen must have undergone a prolonged period of
training which was intelligently controlled under settled
conditions of life. It is possible that the so-called Neolithic
folk were chiefly foreigners who exploited the
riches of the country. The evidence in this connection
will be found in the next chapter.</p>

<p>It used to be thought that the introduction of metal
working into Britain was the result of an invasion of
alien peoples, who partly exterminated and partly enslaved
the long-headed Neolithic inhabitants. This view
was based on the evidence afforded by a new type of
grave known as the "Round Barrow". In graves of
this class have been found Bronze Age relics, a distinctive
kind of pottery, and skulls of broad-heads. The
invasion of broad-heads undoubtedly took place, and
their burial customs suggest that their religious beliefs
were not identical with those of the long-heads.
But it remains to be proved that they were the actual
introducers of the bronze industry. They do not appear
to have reached Ireland, where bronze relics are associated
with a long-headed people of comparatively low
stature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
The early Irish bronze forms were obviously obtained
from Spain, while early English bronze forms resemble
those of France and Italy. Cutting implements were
the first to be introduced. This fact does not suggest
that a conquest took place. The implements may have
been obtained by traders. Britain apparently had in
those ancient times its trading colonies, and was visited
by active and enterprising seafarers.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The discovery of metals in Britain and Ireland was,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
no doubt, first made by prospectors who had obtained
experience in working them elsewhere. They may
have simply come to exploit the country. How these
men conducted their investigations is indicated by the
report found in a British Museum manuscript, dating
from about 1603, in which the prospector gives his
reason for believing that gold was to be found on
Crawford Moor in Lanarkshire. He tells that he saw
among the rocks what Scottish miners call "mothers"
and English miners "leaders" or "metalline fumes".
It was believed that the "fumes" arose from veins of
metal and coloured the rocks as smoke passing upward
through a tunnel blackens it, and leaves traces on the
outside. He professed to be able to distinguish between
the colours left by "fumes" of iron, lead, tin, copper, or
silver. On Crawford Moor he found "sparr, keel, and
brimstone" between rocks, and regarded this discovery as
a sure indication that gold was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in situ</i>. The "mothers"
or "leaders" were more pronounced than any he had
ever seen in Cornwall, Somersetshire, about Keswick, or
"any other mineral parts wheresoever I have travelled".<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
Gold was found in this area of Lanarkshire in considerable
quantities, and was no doubt worked in ancient
times. Of special interest in this connection is the fact
that it was part of the territory occupied by Damnonians,<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
who appear to have been a metal-working people.
Besides occupying the richest metal-yielding area in
Scotland, the Damnonians were located in Devon and
Cornwall, and in the east-midland and western parts of
Ireland, in which gold, copper, and tin-stone were found
as in south-western England. The Welsh <i lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">Dyfneint</i>
(Devon) is supposed by some to be connected with a form
of this tribal name. Another form in a Yarrow inscription
is Dumnogeni. In Ireland Inber Domnann is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
old name of Malahide Bay north of Dublin. Domnu,
the genitive of which is Domnann, was the name of an
ancient goddess. In the Irish manuscripts these people
are referred to as Fir-domnann,<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> and associated with the
Fir-bolg (the men with sacks). A sack-carrying people
are represented in Spanish rock paintings that date from
the Azilian till early "Bronze Age" times. In an Irish
manuscript which praises the fair and tall people, the
Fir-bolg and Fir-domnann are included among the
black-eyed and black-haired people, the descendants of
slaves and churls, and "the promoters of discord among
the people".</p>

<p>The reference to "slaves" is of special interest because
the lot of the working miners was in ancient days an
extremely arduous one. In one of his collected records
which describes the method "of the greatest antiquity"
Diodorus Siculus (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> first century) tells how gold-miners,
with lights bound on their foreheads, drove
galleries into the rocks, the fragments of which were
carried out by frail old men and boys. These were
broken small by men in the prime of life. The pounded
stone was then ground in handmills by women: three
women to a mill and "to each of those who bear this
lot, death is better than life". Afterwards the milled
quartz was spread out on an inclined table. Men threw
water on it, work it through their fingers, and dabbed
it with sponges until the lighter matter was removed and
the gold was left behind. The precious metal was placed
in a clay crucible, which was kept heated for five days
and five nights. It may be that the Scandinavian
references to the nine maidens who turn the handle of
the "world mill" which grinds out metal and soil, and
the Celtic references to the nine maidens who are associated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
with the Celtic cauldron, survive from beliefs that
reflected the habits and methods of the ancient metal
workers.</p>

<p>It is difficult now to trace the various areas in which
gold was anciently found in our islands. But this is
not to be wondered at. In Egypt there were once rich
goldfields, especially in the Eastern Desert, where about
100 square miles were so thoroughly worked in ancient
times that "only the merest traces of gold remain".<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
Gold, as has been stated, was formerly found in south-western
England, North Wales, and, as historical records,
archæological data, and place names indicate, in various
parts of Scotland and Ireland. During the period of the
"Great Thaw" a great deal of alluvial gold must have
distributed throughout the country. Silver was found
in various parts. In Sutherland it is mixed with gold
as it is elsewhere with lead. Copper was worked in a
number of districts where the veins cannot in modern
times be economically worked, and tin was found in
Ireland and Scotland as well as in south-western England,
where mining operations do not seem to have been
begun, as Principal Sir John Rhys has shown,<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> until
after the supplies of surface tin were exhausted. Of
special interest in connection with this problem is the
association of megalithic monuments with ancient mine
workings. An interesting fact to be borne in mind in
connection with these relics of the activities and beliefs
of the early peoples is that they represent a distinct
culture of complex character. Mr. T. Eric Peet<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> shows
that the megalithic buildings "occupy a very remarkable
position along a vast seaboard which includes the
Mediterranean coast of Africa and the Atlantic coast of
Europe. In other words, they lie entirely along a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
natural sea route." He gives forcible reasons for arriving
at the conclusion that "it is impossible to consider
megalithic building as a mere phase through which
many nations passed, and it must therefore have been a
system originating with one race, and spreading far and
wide, owing either to trade influence or migration".
He adds:</p>

<p class="blockquote">"Great movements of races by sea were not by any means
unusual in primitive days. In fact, the sea has always been
less of an obstacle to early man than the land with its deserts,
mountains, and unfordable rivers. There is nothing inherently
impossible or even improbable in the suggestion that
a great immigration brought the megalithic monuments from
Sweden to India or vice versa. History is full of instances
of such migrations."</p>

<p>But there must have been a definite reason for these
race movements. It cannot be that in all cases they
were forced merely by natural causes, such as changes
of climate, invasions of the sea, and the drying up of
once fertile districts, or by the propelling influences of
stronger races in every country from the British Isles to
Japan&mdash;that is, in all countries in which megalithic
monuments of similar type are found. The fact that
the megalithic monuments are distributed along "a vast
seaboard" suggests that they were the work of people
who had acquired a culture of common origin, and
were attracted to different countries for the same reason.
What that attraction was is indicated by studying the
elements of the megalithic culture. In a lecture delivered
before the British Association in Manchester in 1915,
Mr. W. J. Perry threw much light on the problem by
showing that the carriers of the culture practised weaving
linen, and in some cases the use of Tyrian purple, pearls,
precious stones, metals, and conch-shell trumpets, as
well as curious beliefs and superstitions attached to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
latter, while they "adopted certain definite metallurgical
methods, as well as mining". Mr. Perry's paper was
subsequently published by the Manchester Literary and
Philosophical Society. It shows that in Western Europe
the megalithic monuments are distributed in those areas
in which ancient pre-Roman and pre-Greek mine workings
and metal washings have been traced. "The same
correspondence", he writes, "seems to hold in the case
of England and Wales. In the latter country the
counties where megalithic structures abound are precisely
those where mineral deposits and ancient mine-workings
occur. In England the grouping in Cumberland,
Westmorland, Northumberland, Durham, and
Derbyshire is precisely that of old mines; in Cornwall
the megalithic structures are mainly grouped west of
Falmouth, precisely in that district where mining has
always been most active."</p>

<p>Pearls, amber, coral, jet, &amp;c., were searched for as well
as metals. The megalithic monuments near pearling
rivers, in the vicinity of Whitby, the main source of
jet, and in Denmark and the Baltic area where amber
was found were, in all likelihood, erected by people who
had come under the spell of the same ancient culture.</p>

<p>When, therefore, we come to deal with groups of
monuments in areas which were unsuitable for agriculture
and unable to sustain large populations, a reasonable
conclusion to draw is that precious metals, precious
stones, or pearls were once found near them. The
pearling beds may have been destroyed or greatly reduced
in value,<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> or the metals may have been worked
out, leaving but slight if any indication that they were
ever <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in situ</i>. Reference has been made to the traces
left by ancient miners in Egypt where no gold is now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
found. In our own day rich gold fields in Australia and
North America have been exhausted. It would be
unreasonable for us to suppose that the same thing did
not happen in our country, even although but slight
traces of the precious metal can now be obtained in areas
which were thoroughly explored by ancient miners.</p>

<p>When early man reached Scotland in search of suitable
districts in which to settle, he was not likely to be
attracted by the barren or semi-barren areas in which
nature grudged soil for cultivation, where pasture lands
were poor and the coasts were lashed by great billows
for the greater part of the year, and the tempests of winter
and spring were particularly severe. Yet in such places
as Carloway, fronting the Atlantic on the west coast of
Lewis, and at Stennis in Orkney, across the dangerous
Pentland Firth, are found the most imposing stone
circles north of Stonehenge and Avebury. Traces of
tin have been found in Lewis, and Orkney has yielded
traces of lead, including silver-lead, copper and zinc, and
has flint in glacial drift. Traces of tin have likewise
been found on the mainlands of Ross-shire and Argyllshire,
in various islands of the Hebrides and in Stirlingshire.
The great Stonehenge circle is like the Callernish
and Stennis circles situated in a semi-barren area, but it
is an area where surface tin and gold were anciently
obtained. One cannot help concluding that the early
people, who populated the wastes of ancient Britain and
erected megalithic monuments, were attracted by something
more tangible than the charms of solitude and
wild scenery. They searched for and found the things
they required. If they found gold, it must be recognized
that there was a psychological motive for the search for
this precious metal. They valued gold, or whatever
other metal they worked in bleak and isolated places,
because they had learned to value it elsewhere.</p>

<p>Who were the people that first searched for, found,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
and used metals in Western Europe? Some have
assumed that the natives themselves did so "as a matter
of course". Such a theory is, however, difficult to
maintain. Gold is a useless metal for all practical purposes.
It is too soft for implements. Besides, it cannot
be found or worked except by those who have acquired
a great deal of knowledge and skill. The men who first
"washed" it from the soil in Britain must have obtained
the necessary knowledge and skill in a country where
it was more plentiful and much easier to work, and
where&mdash;and this point is a most important one&mdash;the
magical and religious beliefs connected with gold have
a very definite history. Copper, tin, and silver were
even more difficult to find and work in Britain. The
ancient people who reached Britain and first worked
metals or collected ores were not the people who were
accustomed to use implements of bone, horn, and flint,
and had been attracted to its shores merely because fish,
fowl, deer, and cows, were numerous. The searchers for
metals must have come from centres of Eastern civilization,
or from colonies of highly skilled peoples that
had been established in Western Europe. They did
not necessarily come to settle permanently in Britain,
but rather to exploit its natural riches.</p>

<p>This conclusion is no mere hypothesis. Siret,<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> the
Belgian archæologist, has discovered in southern Spain
and Portugal traces of numerous settlements of Easterners
who searched for minerals, &amp;c., long before the introduction
of bronze working in Western Europe. They came
during the archæological "Stone Age"; they even
introduced some of the flint implements classed as
Neolithic by the archæologists of a past generation.</p>

<p>These Eastern colonists do not appear to have been an
organized people. Siret considers that they were merely
groups of people from Asia&mdash;probably the Syrian coast&mdash;who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
were in contact with Egypt. During the Empire
period of Egypt, the Egyptian sphere of influence
extended to the borders of Asia Minor. At an earlier
period Babylonian influence permeated the Syrian coast
and part of Asia Minor. The religious beliefs of seafarers
from Syria were likely therefore to bear traces of the
Egyptian and Babylonian religious systems. Evidence
that this was the case has been forthcoming in Spain.</p>

<p>These Eastern colonists not only operated in Spain
and Portugal, but established contact with Northern
Europe. They exported what they had searched for
and found to their Eastern markets. No doubt, they
employed native labour, but they do not appear to have
instructed the natives how to make use of the ores they
themselves valued so highly. In time they were
expelled from Spain and Portugal by the people or
mixed peoples who introduced the working of bronze
and made use of bronze weapons. These bronze carriers
and workers came from Central Europe, where colonies
of peoples skilled in the arts of mining and metal working
had been established. In the Central European
colonies Ægean and Danubian influences have been
detected.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Among the archæological finds, which prove that the
Easterners settled in Iberia before bronze working was
introduced among the natives, are idol-like objects made
of hippopotamus ivory from Egypt, a shell (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dentalium
elephantum</i>) from the Red Sea, objects made from
ostrich eggs which must have been carried to Spain
from Africa, alabaster perfume flasks, cups of marble
and alabaster of Egyptian character which had been
shaped with copper implements, Oriental painted vases
with decorations in red, black, blue, and green,<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> mural
paintings on layers of plaster, feminine statuettes in
alabaster which Siret considers to be of Babylonian type,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
for they differ from Ægean and Egyptian statuettes, a
cult object (found in graves) resembling the Egyptian
<i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">ded</i> amulet, &amp;c. The Iberian burial places of these
Eastern colonists have arched cupolas and entrance
corridors of Egyptian-Mycenæan character.</p>

<p>Of special interest are the beautifully worked flints
associated with these Eastern remains in Spain and
Portugal. Siret draws attention to the fact that no trace
has been found of "flint factories". This particular
flint industry was an entirely new one. It was not a
development of earlier flint-working in Iberia. Apparently
the new industry, which suddenly appears in full
perfection, was introduced by the Eastern colonists. It
afterwards spread over the whole maritime west, including
Scandinavia where the metal implements of more
advanced countries were imitated in flint. This important
fact emphasizes the need for caution in making use
of such a term as "Neolithic Age". Siret's view in this
connection is that the Easterners, who established trading
colonies in Spain and elsewhere, prevented the local use
of metals which they had come to search for and export.
It was part of their policy to keep the natives in ignorance
of the uses to which metals could be put.</p>

<p>Evidence has been forthcoming that the operations of
the Eastern colonies in Spain and Portugal were extended
towards the maritime north. Associated with
the Oriential relics already referred to, Siret has discovered
amber from the Baltic, jet from Britain (apparently
from Whitby in Yorkshire) and the green-stone
called "callais" usually found in beds of tin. The
Eastern seafarers must have visited Northern Europe to
exploit its virgin riches. A green-stone axe was found,
as has been stated, near the boat with the cork plug, which
lay embedded in Clyde silt at Glasgow. Artifacts of
callais have been discovered in Brittany, in the south of
France, in Portugal, and in south-eastern Spain. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
latter area, as Siret has proved, the Easterners worked
silver-bearing lead and copper.</p>

<p>The colonists appear to have likewise searched for and
found gold. A diadem of gold was discovered in a
necropolis in the south of Spain, where some eminent
ancient had been interred. This find is, however, an
exception. Precious metals do not as a rule appear in
the graves of the period under consideration.</p>

<p>As has been suggested, the Easterners who exploited
the wealth of ancient Iberia kept the natives in ignorance.
"This ignorance", Siret says, "was the guarantee
of the prosperity of the commerce carried on by the
strangers.... The first action of the East on the
West was the exploitation for its exclusive and personal
profit of the virgin riches of the latter." These early
Westerners had no idea of the use and value of the
metals lying on the surface of their native land, while
the Orientals valued them, were in need of them, and
were anxious to obtain them. As Siret puts it:</p>

<p class="blockquote">"The West was a cow to be milked, a sheep to be fleeced,
a field to be cultivated, a mine to be exploited."</p>

<p>In the traditions preserved by classical writers, there
are references to the skill and cunning of the Ph&oelig;nicians
in commerce, and in the exploitation of colonies founded
among the ignorant Iberians. They did not inform
rival traders where they found metals. "Formerly",
as Strabo says, "the Ph&oelig;nicians monopolized the trade
from Gades (Cadiz) with the islanders (of the Cassiterides);
and they kept the route a close secret." A vague
ancient tradition is preserved by Pliny, who tells that
"tin was first fetched from Cassiteris (the tin island) by
Midacritus".<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> We owe it to the secretive Ph&oelig;nicians
that the problem of the Cassiterides still remains a
difficult one to solve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
To keep the native people ignorant the Easterners,
Siret believes, forbade the use of metals in their own
colonies. A direct result of this policy was the great
development which took place in the manufacture of the
beautiful flint implements already referred to. These
the natives imitated, never dreaming that they were imitating
some forms that had been developed by a people
who used copper in their own country. When, therefore,
we pick up beautiful Neolithic flints, we cannot be too
sure that the skill displayed belongs entirely to the
"Stone Age", or that the flints "evolved" from earlier
native forms in those areas in which they are found.</p>

<p>The Easterners do not appear to have extracted the
metals from their ores either in Iberia or in Northern
Europe. Tin-stone and silver-bearing lead were used
for ballast for their ships, and they made anchors of
lead. Gold washed from river beds could be easily
packed in small bulk. A people who lived by hunting
and fishing were not likely to be greatly interested in
the laborious process of gold-washing. Nor were they
likely to attach to gold a magical and religious value as
did the ancient Egyptians and Sumerians.</p>

<p>So far as can be gathered from the Iberian evidence,
the period of exploitation by the colonists from the East
was a somewhat prolonged one. How many centuries
it covered we can only guess. It is of interest to find,
in this connection, however, that something was known
in Mesopotamia before 2000 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> regarding the natural
riches of Western Europe. Tablets have recently been
found on the site of Asshur, the ancient capital of Assyria,
which was originally a Sumerian settlement. These
make reference to the Empire of Sargon of Akkad (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">c.</i>
2600 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>), which, according to tradition, extended from
the Persian Gulf to the Syrian coast. Sargon was a
great conqueror. "He poured out his glory over the
world", declares a tablet found a good many years ago.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
It was believed, too, that Sargon embarked on the Mediterranean
and occupied Cyprus. The fresh evidence
from the site of Asshur is to the effect that he conquered
Kaptara (?Crete) and "the Tin Land beyond the Upper
Sea" (the Mediterranean). The explanation may be
that he obtained control of the markets to which the
Easterners carried from Spain and the coasts of Northern
Europe the ores, pearls, &amp;c., they had searched for and
found. It may be, therefore, that Britain was visited
by Easterners even before Sargon's time, and that the
Glasgow boat with the plug of cork was manned by dark
Orientals who were prospecting the Scottish coast before
the last land movement had ceased&mdash;that is, some time
after 3000 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></p>

<p>When the Easterners were expelled from Spain by a
people from Central Europe who used weapons of
bronze, some of them appear to have found refuge in
Gaul. Siret is of opinion that others withdrew from
Brittany, where subsidences were taking place along the
coast, leaving their megalithic monuments below high-water
mark, and even under several feet of water as at
Morbraz. He thinks that the settlements of Easterners
in Brittany were invaded at one and the same time by
the enemy and the ocean. Other refugees from the
colonies may have settled in Etruria, and founded the
Etruscan civilization. Etruscan menhirs resemble those
of the south of France, while the Etruscan crozier or
wand, used in the art of augury, resembles the croziers
of the megaliths, &amp;c., of France, Spain, and Portugal.
There are references in Scottish Gaelic stories to "magic
wands" possessed by "wise women", and by the
mothers of Cyclopean one-eyed giants. Ammianus
Marcellinus, quoting Timagenes,<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> attributes to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
Druids the statement that part of the inhabitants of Gaul
were indigenous, but that some had come from the
farthest shores and districts across the Rhine, "having
been expelled from their own lands by frequent wars
and the encroachments of the ocean".</p>

<p>The bronze-using peoples who established overland
trade routes in Europe, displacing in some localities the
colonies of Easterners and isolating others, must have
instructed the natives of Western Europe how to mine
and use metals. Bronze appears to have been introduced
into Britain by traders. That the ancient Britons did
not begin quite spontaneously to work copper and tin
and manufacture bronze is quite evident, because the
earliest specimens of British bronze which have been
found are made of ninety per cent of copper and ten per
cent of tin as on the Continent. "Now, since a knowledge
of the compound", wrote Dr. Robert Munro,
"implies a previous acquaintance with its component
elements, it follows that progress in metallurgy had
already reached the stage of knowing the best combination
of these metals for the manufacture of cutting tools
before bronze was practically known in Britain."<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>The furnaces used were not invented in Britain. Professor
Gowland has shown that in Europe and Asia the
system of working mines and melting metals was identical
in ancient times. Summarizing Professor Gowland's
articles in <cite>Archæologia</cite> and the <cite>Journal of the
Royal Anthropological Institute</cite>, Mr. W. J. Perry writes
in this connection:<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> "The furnaces employed were
similar; the crucibles were of the same material, and
generally of the same form; the process of smelting,
first on the surface and then in the crucibles was found
everywhere, even persisting down to present times in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
the absence of any fresh cultural influence. The study
of the technique of mining and smelting has served to
consolidate the floating mass of facts which we have
accumulated, and to add support for the contention that
one cultural influence is responsible for the earliest
mining and smelting and washing of metals and the
getting of precious stones and metals. The cause of
the distribution of the megalithic culture was the search
for certain forms of material wealth."</p>

<p>That certain of the megalithic monuments were intimately
connected with the people who attached a
religious value to metals is brought out very forcibly in
the references to pagan customs and beliefs in early
Christian Gaelic literature. There are statements in the
Lives of St. Patrick regarding a pagan god called "Cenn
Cruach" and "Crom Cruach" whose stone statue was
"adorned with gold and silver, and surrounded by
twelve other statues with bronze ornaments". The
"statue" is called "the king idol of Erin", and it is
stated that "the twelve idols were made of stone, but he
('Crom Cruach') was of gold". To this god of a stone
circle were offered up "the firstlings of every issue and
the chief scions of every clan". Another idol was called
Crom Dubh ("Black Crom"), and his name "is still
connected", O'Curry has written, "with the first Sunday
of August in Munster and Connaught". An Ulster
idol was called Crom Chonnaill, which was either a
living animal or a tree, or was "believed to have been
such", O'Curry says. De Jubainville translates <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Cenn
Cruach</i> as "Bloody Head" and <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Crom Cruach</i> as
"Bloody Curb" or "Bloody Crescent". O'Curry, on
the other hand, translates <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Crom Cruach</i> as "Bloody
Maggot" and <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Crom Dubh</i> as "Black Maggot". In
Gaelic legends "maggots" or "worms" are referred to
as forms of supernatural beings. The maggot which
appeared on the flesh of a slain animal was apparently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
regarded as a new form assumed by the indestructible
soul, just as in the Egyptian story of Bata the germ of
life passes from his bull form in a drop of blood from
which two trees spring up, and then in a chip from one
of the trees from which the man is restored in his
original form.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> A similar belief, which is widespread,
is that bees have their origin as maggots placed in trees.
One form of the story was taken over by the early
Christians, which tells that Jesus was travelling with
Peter and Paul and asked hospitality from an old
woman. The woman refused it and struck Paul on the
head. When the wound putrified maggots were produced.
Jesus took the maggots from the wound and
placed them in the hollow of a tree. When next they
passed that way, "Jesus directed Paul to look in the
tree hollow where, to his surprise, he found bees and
honey sprung from his own head".<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> The custom of
placing crape on hives and "telling the bees" when a
death takes place, which still survives in the south of
England and in the north of Scotland, appears to be
connected with the ancient belief that the maggot, bee,
and tree were connected with the sacred animal and the
sacred stone in which was the spirit of a deity. Sacred
trees and sacred stones were intimately connected.
Tacitus tells us that the Romans invaded Mona (Anglesea),
they destroyed the sacred groves in which the
Druids and black-robed priestesses covered the altars
with the blood of captives.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> There are a number of
dolmens on this island and traces of ancient mine-workings,
indicating that it had been occupied by the
early seafarers who colonized Britain and Ireland and
worked metals. A connection between the tree cult of
the Druids and the cult of the builders of megaliths is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
thus suggested by Tacitus, as well as by the Irish
evidence regarding the Ulster idol Crom Chonnaill,
referred to above (see also <a href="#Page_140">Chapter XII</a>).</p>

<p>Who were the people that followed the earliest
Easterners and visited our shores to search like them
for metals and erect megalithic monuments? It is impossible
to answer that question with certainty. There
were after the introduction of bronze working, as has been
indicated, intrusions of aliens. These included the introducers
of the short-barrow method of burial and the later
introducers of burial by cremation. It does not follow
that all intrusions were those of conquerors. Traders
and artisans may have come with their families in large
numbers and mingled with the earlier peoples. Some
intruders appear to have come by overland routes from
southern and central France and from Central Europe
and the Danube valley, while others came across the sea
from Spain. That a regular over-seas trade-route was
in existence is indicated by the references made by
classical writers to the Cassiterides (Tin Islands).
Strabo tells that the natives "bartered tin and hides
with merchants for pottery, salt, and articles of bronze".
The Ph&oelig;nicians, as has been noted, "monopolized the
trade from Gades (Cadiz) with the islanders and kept the
route a close secret". It was probably along this sea-route
that Egyptian blue beads reached Britain. Professor
Sayce has identified a number of these in Devizes
Museum, and writes:</p>

<p class="blockquote">"They are met with plentifully in the Early Bronze Age
tumuli of Wiltshire in association with amber beads and
barrel-shaped beads of jet or lignite. Three of them come
from Stonehenge itself. Similar beads of ivory have been
found in a Bronze Age cist near Warminster: if the material
is really ivory it must have been derived from the East. The
cylindrical faience beads, it may be added, have been discovered
in Dorsetshire as well as in Wiltshire."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
Professor Sayce emphasizes that these blue beads
"belong to one particular period in Egyptian history,
the latter part of the Eighteenth Dynasty and the earlier
part of the Nineteenth Dynasty.... The period to
which they belong may be dated 1450-1250 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and as
we must allow some time for their passage across the
trade routes to Wiltshire an approximate date for their
presence in the British barrows will be 1300 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>"</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_136.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>Beads from Bronze Age Barrows on Salisbury Plain</p>

<p>The large central bead and the small round ones are of amber; the long plain
ones are of jet; and the long segmented or notched beads are of an opaque blue
substance (faience).</p>
</div></div>

<p>Dr. H. R. Hall, of the British Museum, who discovered,
at Deir el-Bahari in Egypt, "thousands of blue
glaze beads of the exact particular type of those found
in Britain", says that they date back till "about 1500
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>". He noted the resemblance before Professor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
Sayce had written. "It is gratifying", he comments,
"that the Professor agrees that the Devizes beads are
undoubtedly Egyptian, as an important voice is thereby
added to the consensus of opinion on the subject."
Similar beads have been found in the "Middle Bronze
Age in Crete and in Western Europe". Dr. Hall
thinks the Egyptian beads may have reached Britain
as early as "about 1400 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>".<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> We have thus provided
for us an early date in British history, based on the
well authenticated chronology of the Empire period of
Ancient Egypt. Easterners, or traders in touch with
Easterners, reached our shores carrying Egyptian beads
shortly before or early in the fourteenth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
At this time amber was being imported into the south
of England from the Baltic, while jet was being carried
from Whitby in Yorkshire.</p>

<p>After the introduction of bronze working in Western
Europe the natives began to work and use metals.
These could not have been Celts, for in the fourteenth
century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> the Celts had not yet reached Western
Europe.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> The earliest searchers for metals who visited
Britain must therefore have been the congeners of those
who erected the megalithic monuments in the metal-yielding
areas of Spain and Portugal and north-western
France.</p>

<p>It would appear that the early Easterners exploited
the virgin riches of Western Europe for a long period&mdash;perhaps
for over a thousand years&mdash;and that, after their
Spanish colonies were broken up by a bronze-using
people from Central Europe, the knowledge of how to
work metals spread among the natives. Overland trade
routes were then opened up. At first these were controlled
in Western Europe by the Iberians. In time the Celts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
swept westward and formed with the natives mixed
communities of Celtiberians. The Easterners appear to
have inaugurated a new era in Western European commerce
after the introduction of iron working. They had
colonies in the south and west of Europe and on the
North African coast, and obtained supplies of metals,
&amp;c., by sea. They kept the sea-routes secret. British
ores, &amp;c., were carried to Spain and Carthage. After
Pytheas visited Britain (see next <a href="#Page_109">chapter</a>) the overland
trade-route to Marseilles was opened up. Supplies of
surface tin having become exhausted, tin-mines were
opened in Cornwall. The trade of Britain then came
under the control of Celtiberian and Celtic peoples, who
had acquired their knowledge of shipbuilding and
navigation from the Easterners and the mixed descendants
of Eastern and Iberian peoples.</p>

<p>It does not follow that the early and later Easterners
were all of one physical type. They, no doubt, brought
with them their slaves, including miners and seamen,
drawn from various countries where they had been purchased
or abducted.</p>

<p>The men who controlled the ancient trade were not
necessarily permanent settlers in Western Europe.
When the carriers of bronze from Central Europe
obtained control of the Iberian colonies, many traders
may have fled to other countries, but many colonists, and
especially the workers, may have become the slaves of
the intruders, as did the Fir-bolgs of Ireland who were
subdued by the Celts. The Damnonians of Britain and
Ireland who occupied mineral areas may have been a
"wave" of early Celtic or Celtiberian people. Ultimately
the Celts came, as did the later Normans, and
formed military aristocracies over peoples of mixed
descent. The idea that each intrusion involved the
extermination of earlier peoples is a theory which does
not accord with the evidence of the ancient Gaelic manuscripts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
of classical writers, of folk tradition, and of existing
race types in different areas in Britain and Ireland.</p>

<p>A people who exterminated those they conquered
would have robbed themselves of the chief fruits of
conquest. In ancient as in later times the aim of
conquest was to obtain the services of a subject people
and the control of trade.</p>

Traders</small></h2>

<p>The beginnings of the Bronze and Iron Ages in Britain
are, according to the chronology favoured by archæologists,
separated by about a thousand years. During
this long period only two or three invasions appear to
have taken place, but it is uncertain, as has been indicated,
whether these came as sudden outbursts from the Continent
or were simply gradual and peaceful infiltrations
of traders and settlers. We really know nothing about
the broad-headed people who introduced the round-barrow
system of burial, or of the people who cremated
their dead. The latter became predominant in
south-western England and part of Wales. In the north
of England the cremating people were less numerous.
If they were conquerors they may have, as has been suggested,
represented military aristocracies. It may be,
however, on the other hand, that the cremation custom
had in some areas more a religious than a racial significance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
The beliefs associated with cremation of the
dead may have spread farther than the people who introduced
the new religion. It would appear that the habit
of burning the dead was an expression of the beliefs
that souls were transported by means of fire to the Otherworld
paradise. As much is indicated by Greek evidence.
Homer's heroes burned their dead, and when the ghost
of Patroklos appeared to his friend Achilles in a dream,
he said: "Thou sleepest, and hast forgotten me, O
Achilles. Not in my life wast thou unmindful of me,
but in my death. Bury me with all speed, that I may
pass the gates of Hades. Far off the spirits banish me,
the phantoms of men outworn, nor suffer me to mingle
with them beyond the River, but vainly I wander along
the wide-gated dwelling of Hades. Now give me, I pray
pitifully of thee, thy hand, for never more again shall
I come back from Hades, when ye have given me my
due of fire."<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The Arab traveller Ibn Haukal, who
describes a tenth-century cremation ceremony at Kieff,
was addressed by a Russ, who said: "As for you Arabs
you are mad, for those who are the most dear to you,
and whom you honour most, you place in the ground,
where they will become a prey to worms, whereas with
us they are burned in an instant and go straight to
Paradise."<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>The cremating people, who swept into Greece and
became the over-lords of the earlier settlers, were represented
in the western movement of tribes towards Gaul
and Britain. It is uncertain where the cremation
custom had origin. Apparently it entered Europe from
Asia. The Vedic Aryans who invaded Northern India
worshipped the fire-god Agni, who was believed to carry
souls to Paradise; they cremated their dead and combined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
with it the practice of <i lang="hi" xml:lang="hi">suttee</i>, that is, of burning
the widows of the dead. In Gaul, however, as we
gather from Julius Cæsar, only those widows suspected of
being concerned in the death of their husbands were
burned. The Norsemen, however, were acquainted
with <i lang="hi" xml:lang="hi">suttee</i>. In one of the Volsung lays Brynhild rides
towards the pyre on which Sigurd is being burned, and
casts herself into the flames. The Russians strangled
and burned widows when great men were cremated.</p>

<p>The cremating people erected megalithic monuments,
some of which cover their graves in Britain and elsewhere.</p>

<p>In some districts the intruders of the Bronze Age
were the earliest settlers. The evidence of the graves in
Buchan, Aberdeenshire, for instance, shows that the
broad-heads colonized that area. It may be that, like
the later Norsemen, bands of people sought for new
homes in countries where the struggle for existence
would be less arduous than in their own, which suffered
from over population, and did not land at points where
resistance was offered to them. Agriculturists would, no
doubt, select areas suitable for their mode of life and
favour river valleys, while seafarers and fishermen
would cling to the coasts. The tendency of fishermen
and agriculturists to live apart in separate communities
has persisted till our own time. There are fishing
villages along the east coast of Scotland the inhabitants
of which rarely intermarry with those who draw their
means of sustenance from the land.</p>

<p>During the Bronze Age Celtic peoples were filtering
into Britain from Gaul. They appear to have come
originally from the Danube area as conquerors who
imposed their rule on the people they subjected. Like
the Achæans who overran Greece they seem to have
originally been a vigorous pastoral people who had
herds of pigs, were "horse-tamers", used chariots, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
were fierce and impetuous in battle. In time they
crossed the Rhine and occupied Gaul. They overcame
the Etruscans. In 390 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> they sacked Rome. Their
invasion of Greece occurred in the third century, but
their attempt to reach Delphi was frustrated. Crossing
into Asia Minor they secured a footing in the area
subsequently known as Galatia, and their descendants
there were addressed in an epistle by St. Paul.</p>

<p>Like the Achæans, the Celts appear to have absorbed
the culture of the Ægean area and that of the Ægean
colony at Hallstatt in Austria. They were withal the
"carriers" of the La Tène Iron Age culture to Britain
and Ireland. The potter's wheel was introduced by
them into Britain during the archæological early Iron
Age. It is possible that the cremating people of the
Bronze Age were a Celtic people. But later "waves"
of the fighting charioteers did not cremate their dead.</p>

<p>Sharp difference of opinion exists between scholars
regarding the Celts. Some identify them with the dark-haired,
broad-headed Armenoids, and others with the
tall and fair long-headed people of Northern Europe.
It is possible that the Celts were not a pure race, but
rather a confederacy of peoples who were influenced at
different periods by different cultures. That some sections
were confederacies or small nations of blended
people is made evident by classic references to the
Celtiberians, the Celto-Scythians, the Celto-Ligyes, the
Celto-Thracians, and the Celtillyrians. On reaching
Britain they mingled with the earlier settlers, forming
military aristocracies, and dominating large areas. The
fair Caledonians of Scotland had a Celtic tribal name,
and used chariots in battle like the Continental Celts.
Two Caledonian personal names are known&mdash;Calgacus
("swordsman") and Argentocoxus ("white foot"). In
Ireland the predominant tribes before and during the
early Roman period were of similar type. Queen Meave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
of Connaught was like Queen Boadicea<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> of the Iceni, a
fair-haired woman who rode to battle in a chariot.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The Continental trade routes up the Danube and
Rhone valleys leading towards Britain were for some
centuries under the control of the Celts. It was no
doubt to obtain a control over trade that they entered
Britain and Ireland. On the Continent they engaged
in pork curing, and supplied Rome and indeed the
whole of Italy with smoked and salted bacon. Dr.
Sullivan tells that among the ancient Irish the general
name for bacon was <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">tini</i>. Smoke-cured hams and
flitches were called <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">tineiccas</i>, which "is almost identical
in form with the Gallo-Roman word <i>taniaccae</i> or <i>tanacae</i>
used by Varro for hams imported from Transalpine
Gaul into Rome and other parts of Italy". Puddings
prepared from the blood of pigs&mdash;now known as "black
puddings"&mdash;were, we learn from Varro, likewise exported
from Gaul to Italy. The ancient Irish were
partial to "black puddings".<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> It would appear, therefore,
that the so-called dreamy Celt was a greasy pork
merchant.</p>

<p>According to Strabo the exports from Britain in the
early part of the first century consisted of gold, silver,
and iron, wheat, cattle, skins, slaves, and dogs; while
the imports included ivory ornaments, such as bracelets,
amber beads, and glass. Tin was exported from Cornwall
to Gaul, and carried overland to Marseilles, but
this does not appear to have been the earliest route.
As has been indicated, tin appears to have been carried,
before the Celts obtained control of British trade, by the
sea route to the Carthaginian colonies in Spain.</p>

<p>The Carthaginians had long kept secret the sources
of their supplies of tin from the group of islands known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
as the Cassiterides. About 322 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, however, the
Greek merchants at Marseilles fitted out an expedition
which was placed in charge of Pytheas, a mathematician,
for the purpose of exploring the northern area. This
scholar wrote an account of his voyage, but only fragments
of it quoted by different ancient authors have
come down to us. He appears to have coasted round
Spain and Brittany, and to have sailed up the English
Channel to Kent, to have reached as far north as Orkney
and Shetland, and perhaps, as some think, Iceland, to
have crossed the North Sea towards the mouth of the
Baltic, and explored a part of the coast of Norway. He
returned to Britain, which he appears to have partly
explored before crossing over to Gaul. In an extract
from his diary, quoted by Strabo, he tells that the Britons
in certain districts not detailed grew corn, millet, and
vegetables. Such of them as had corn and honey made
a beverage from these materials. They brought the
corn ears into great houses (barns) and threshed them
there, for on account of the rain and lack of sunshine
out-door threshing floors were of little use to them.
Pytheas noted that in Britain the days were longer and
the nights brighter than in the Mediterranean area. In
the northern parts he visited the nights were so short that
the interval between sunset and sunrise was scarcely
perceptible. The farthest north headland of Britain was
Cape Orcas.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Six days sail north of Britain lay Thule,
which was situated near the frozen sea. There a day
lasted six months and a night for the same space of
time.</p>

<p>Another extract refers to hot springs in Britain, and a
presiding deity identified with Minerva, in whose temple
"the fires never go out, yet never whiten into ashes;
when the fire has got dull it turns into round lumps like
stones". Apparently coal was in use at a temple situated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
at Bath. Timæus, a contemporary of Pytheas, quoting
from the lost diary of the explorer, states that tin was
found on an island called Mictis, lying inwards (northward)
at a distance of six days' sail from Britain. The
natives made voyages to and from the island in their
canoes of wickerwork covered with hides. Mictis could
not have been Cornwall or an island in the English
Channel. Strabo states that Crassus, who succeeded in
reaching the Cassiterides, announced that the distance
to them was greater than that from the Continent to
Britain, and he found that the tin ore lay on the surface.
Evidently tin was not mined on the island of Mictis as
it was in Cornwall in later times.</p>

<p>An earlier explorer than Pytheas was Himilco, the
Carthaginian. He reached Britain about 500 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> A
Latin metrical rendering of his lost work was made by
Rufus Festus Avienus in the fourth century of our era.
Reference is made to the islands called the &OElig;strymnides
that "raise their heads, lie scattered, and are rich in tin
and lead". These islands were visited by Himilco, and
were distant "two days voyage from the Sacred Island
(Ireland) and near the broad Isle of the Albiones". As
Rufus Festus Avienus refers to "the hardy folk of
Britain", his Albiones may have been the people of
Scotland. The name Albion was originally applied to
England and Scotland. In the first century, however,
Latin writers never used "Albion" except as a curiosity,
and knew England as Britain. According to Himilco,
the Tartessi of Spain were wont to trade with the natives
of the northern tin islands. Even the Carthaginians
"were accustomed to visit these seas". From other
sources we learn that the Ph&oelig;nicians carried tin from the
Cassiterides direct to the Spanish port of Corbilo, the
exact location of which is uncertain.</p>

</div></div>

<p>It is of special importance to note that the tin-stone
was collected on the surface of the islands before mining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
operations were conducted elsewhere. In all probability
the laborious work of digging mines was not commenced
before the available surface supplies became scanty.
According to Sir John Rhys<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> the districts in southern
England, where surface tin was first obtained, were
"chiefly Dartmoor, with the country round Tavistock
and that around St. Austell, including several valleys
looking towards the southern coast of Cornwall. In
most of the old districts where tin existed, it is supposed
to have lain too deep to have been worked in early
times." When, however, Poseidonius visited Cornwall
in the first century of our era, he found that a beginning
had been made in skilful mining operations. It may be
that the trade with the Cassiterides was already languishing
on account of changed political conditions and the
shortage of supplies.</p>

<p>Where then were the Cassiterides? M. Reinach
struck at the heart of the problem when he asked, "In
what western European island is tin found?" Those
writers who have favoured the group of islands off the
north-western coast of Spain are confronted by the difficulty
that these have failed to yield traces of tin, while
those writers who favour Cornwall and the Scilly Islands
cannot ignore the precise statements that the "tin
islands" were farther distant from the Continent than
Britain, and that in the time of Pytheas tin was carried
from Mictis, which was six days' sail from Britain. The
fact that traces of tin, copper, and lead have been found
in the Hebrides is therefore of special interest. Copper,
too, has been found in Shetland, and lead and zinc in
Orkney. Withal there are Gaelic place-names in which
<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">staoin</i> (tin) is referred to, in Islay, Jura (where there are
traces of old mine-workings), in Iona, and on the mainland
of Ross-shire. Traces of tin are said to have been
found in Lewis where the great stone circle of Callernish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
in a semi-barren area indicates the presence at one time
in its area of a considerable population. The Hebrides
may well have been the &OElig;strymnides of Himilco and
the Cassiterides of classical writers. Jura or Iona may
have been the Mictis of Pytheas. Tin-stone has been
found in Ireland too, near Dublin, in Wicklow, and in
Killarney.</p>

<p>The short dark people in the Hebrides and Orkney
may well be, like the Silurians of Wales, the descendants
of the ancient mine workers. They have been referred
to by some as descendants of the crews of wrecked ships
of the Spanish Armada, and by others as remnants of
the Lost Ten Tribes.</p>

<p>In Irish Gaelic literature, however, there is evidence
that the dark people were in ancient times believed to be
the descendants of the Fir-bolgs (men with sacks), the
Fir-domnann (the men who dug the ground), and the
Galioin (Gauls). Campbell in his <cite>West Highland Tales</cite>
has in a note referred to the dark Hebrideans. "Behind
the fire", he wrote, "sat a girl with one of those
strange faces which are occasionally to be seen in the
Western Isles, a face which reminded me of the Nineveh
sculptures, and of faces seen in San Sebastian. Her hair
was black as night, and her clear dark eyes glittered
through the peat smoke. Her complexion was dark,
and her features so unlike those who sat about her that
I asked if she were a native of the island (of Barra), and
learned that she was a Highland girl." It may be that
the dark Eastern people were those who introduced the
Eastern and non-Celtic, non-Teutonic prejudice against
pork as food into Scotland. In Ireland the Celtic people
apparently obliterated the "taboo" at an early period.</p>

<p>It was during the Archæological Late Bronze and
Early Iron Ages that the Celtic artistic patterns reached
England. These betray affinities with Ægean motifs,
and they were afterwards developed in Ireland and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
Scotland. In both countries they were fused with symbols
of Egyptian and Anatolian origin.</p>

<p>Like the Celts and the pre-Hellenic people of Greece
and Crete, the Britons and the Irish wore breeches.
The Roman poet, Martial,<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> satirizes a <i>life</i> "as loose as
the old breeches of a British pauper". Claudian, the
poet, pictures Britannia with her cheeks tattoed and
wearing a sea-coloured cloak and a cap of bear-skin.
The fact that the Caledonians fought with scanty clothing,
as did the Greeks, and as did the Highlanders in
historic times, must not be taken as proof that they
could not manufacture cloth. According to Rhys,
Briton means a "cloth clad"<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> person. The bronze
fibulæ found at Bronze Age sites could not have been
used to fasten heavy skins.</p>

<p>When the Romans reached Britain, the natives, like
the heroes of Homer, used chariots, and had weapons
of bronze and iron. The archæology of the ancient
Irish stories is of similar character.</p>

<p>In the Bronze Age the swords were pointed and
apparently used chiefly for thrusting. The conquerors
who introduced the unpointed iron swords were able
to shatter the brittle bronze weapons. These iron
swords were in turn superseded by the pointed and
well-tempered swords of the Romans. But it was not
only their superior weapons, their discipline, and their
knowledge of military strategy that brought the Romans
success. England was broken up into a number of
petty kingdoms. "Our greatest advantage", Tacitus
confessed, "in dealing with such powerful people is
that they cannot act in concert; it is seldom that even
two or three tribes will join in meeting a common
danger; and so while each fights for himself they are
all conquered together."<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
When the Britons, under Agricola, began to adopt
Roman civilization they "rose superior", Tacitus says,
"by the forces of their natural genius, to the attainments
of the Gauls". In time they adopted the Roman
dress,<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> which may have been the prototype of the kilt.
The Roman language supplanted the Celtic dialects
in certain parts of England.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
<small>Races of Britain and Ireland</small></h2>

<p class="blockquote">Colours of Ancient Races and Mythical Ages&mdash;Caucasian Race
Theory&mdash;The Aryan or Indo-European Theory&mdash;Races and Languages&mdash;Celts
and Teutons&mdash;Fair and Dark Palæolithic Peoples in Modern
Britain&mdash;Mediterranean Man&mdash;The Armenoid or Alpine Broad-heads&mdash;Ancient
British Tribes&mdash;Cruithne and Picts&mdash;The Picts of the
"Brochs" as Pirates and Traders&mdash;Picts and Fairies&mdash;Scottish Types&mdash;Racial
"Pockets".</p>

<p>The race problem has ever been one of engrossing
interest to civilized peoples. In almost every old
mythology we meet with theories that were formulated
to account for the existence of the different races living
in the world, and for the races that were supposed to
have existed for a time and became extinct. An outstanding
feature of each racial myth is that the people
among whom it grew up are invariably represented to
be the finest type of humanity.</p>

<p>A widespread habit, and one of great antiquity, was
to divide the races, as the world was divided, into
four sections, and to distinguish them by their colours.
The colours were those of the cardinal points and chiefly
Black, White, Red, and Yellow. The same system was
adopted in dealing with extinct races. Each of these were
coloured according to the Age in which they had existence,
and the colours were connected with metals.
In Greece and India, for instance, the "Yellow Age"
was a "Golden Age", the "White Age" a "Silver
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
Age", the "Red Age" a "Bronze Age", and the
"Black Age" an "Iron Age".</p>

<p>Although the old theories regarding the mythical
ages and mythical races have long been discarded,
the habit of dividing mankind and their history into
four sections, according to colours and the metals chiefly
used by them, is not yet extinct. We still speak of
the "Black man", the "Yellow man", the "Red
man", and the "White man". Archæologists have
divided what they call the "pre-history of mankind"
into the two "Stone Ages", the "Bronze Age" and the
"Iron Age". The belief that certain races have become
extinct as the result of conquest by invaders is
still traceable in those histories that refer, for instance,
to the disappearance of "Stone Age man" or "Bronze
Age man", or of the British Celts, or of the Picts of
Scotland.</p>

<p>That some races have completely disappeared there
can be no shadow of a doubt. As we have seen,
Neanderthal man entirely vanished from the face of the
globe, and has not left a single descendant among the
races of mankind. In our own day the Tasmanians
have become extinct. These cases, however, are exceptional.
The complete extinction of a race is an
unusual thing in the history of mankind. A section
may vanish in one particular area and yet persist in
another. As a rule, in those districts where races are
supposed to have perished, it is found that they have
been absorbed by intruders. In some cases the chief
change has been one of racial designation and nationality.</p>

<p>Crô-Magnon man, who entered Europe when the
Neanderthals were hunting the reindeer and other
animals, is still represented in our midst. Dr. Collignon,
the French ethnologist, who has found many
representatives of this type in the Dordogne valley
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
where their ancestors lived in the decorated cave-dwellings
before their organization was broken up by the
Azilian and other intruders, shows that the intrusion
of minorities of males rarely leaves a permanent change
in a racial type. The alien element tends to disappear.
"When", he writes, "a race is well seated
in a region, fixed to the soil by agriculture, acclimatized
by natural selection and sufficiently dense, it
opposes, for the most precise observations confirm it,
an enormous resistance to new-comers, whoever they
may be." Intruders of the male sex only may be bred
out in time.</p>

<p>Our interest here is with the races of Britain and
Ireland, but, as our native islands were peopled from
the Continent, we cannot ignore the evidence afforded
by Western and Northern Europe when dealing with
our own particular phase of the racial problem.</p>

<p>It is necessary in the first place to get rid of certain
old theories that were based on imperfect knowledge
or wrong foundations. One theory applies the term
"Caucasian Man" to either a considerable section or
the majority of European peoples. "The utter absurdity
of the misnomer Caucasian, as applied to the
blue-eyed and fair-haired Aryan (?) race of Western
Europe, is revealed", says Ripley,<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> "by two indisputable
facts. In the first place, this ideal blond type
does not occur within many hundred miles of Caucasia;
and, secondly, nowhere along the great Caucasian chain
is there a single native tribe making use of a purely
inflectional or Aryan language."</p>

<p>The term "Aryan" is similarly a misleading one.
It was invented by Professor Max Müller and applied
by him chiefly to a group of languages at a time
when races were being identified by the languages
they spoke. These peoples&mdash;with as different physical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
characteristics as have Indians and Norseman, or
Russians and Spaniards, who spoke Indo-European, or,
as German scholars have patriotically adapted the term,
Indo-Germanic languages&mdash;were regarded by ethnologists
of the "philological school" as members of the
one Indo-European or Aryan race or "family".
Language, however, is no sure indication of race. The
spread of a language over wide areas may be accounted
for by trade or political influence or cultural contact.
In our own day the English language is spoken by
"Black", "Yellow", and "Red", as well as by
"White" peoples.</p>

<p>A safer system is to distinguish racial types by their
physical peculiarities. When, however, this system is
applied in Europe, as elsewhere, we shall still find
differences between peoples. Habits of thought and
habits of life exercise a stronger influence over individuals,
and groups of individuals, than do, for instance,
the shape of their heads, the colours of their
hair, eyes, and skin, or the length and strength of
their limbs. Two particular individuals may be
typical representatives of a distinct race and yet not
only speak different languages, but have a different
outlook on life, and different ideas as to what is right
and what is wrong. Different types of people are in
different parts of the world united by their sense of
nationality. They are united by language, traditions,
and beliefs, and by their love of a particular locality
in which they reside or in which their ancestors were
wont to reside. A sense of nationality, such as unites
the British Empire, may extend to far-distant parts of
the world.</p>

</div></div>

<p>But, while conscious of the uniting sense of nationality,
our people are at the same time conscious of and
interested in their physical differences and the histories
of different sections of our countrymen. The problem as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
to whether we are mainly Celtic or mainly Teutonic is
one of perennial interest.</p>

<p>Here again, when dealing with the past, we meet with
the same condition of things that prevail at the present
day. Both the ancient Celts and the people they called
Teutons ("strangers") were mixed peoples with different
physical peculiarities. The Celts known to the Greeks
were a tall, fair-haired people. In Western Europe, as
has been indicated, they mingled with the dark Iberians,
and a section of the mingled races was known to the
Romans as Celtiberians. The Teutons included the
tall, fair, long-headed Northerners, and the dark, medium-sized,
broad-headed Central Europeans. Both the fair
Celts and the fair Teutons appear to have been sections
of the northern race known to antiquaries as the "Baltic
people", or "Maglemosians", who entered Europe
from Siberia and "drifted" along the northern and
southern shores of the Baltic Sea&mdash;the ancient "White
Sea" of the "White people" of the "White North".
As we have seen, other types of humanity were "drifting"
towards Britain at the same time&mdash;that is, before
the system of polishing stone implements and weapons
inaugurated what has been called the "Neolithic
Age".</p>

<p>As modern-day ethnologists have found that the
masses of the population in Great Britain and Ireland
are of the early types known to archæologists as Palæolithic,
Neolithic, and Bronze Age men, the race history
of our people may be formulated as follows:</p>

<p>The earliest inhabitants of our islands whose physical
characteristics can be traced among the living population
were the Crô-Magnon peoples. These were followed
by the fair Northerners, the "carriers" of Maglemosian
culture, and the dark, medium-sized Iberians, who were
the "carriers" of Azilian-Tardenoisian culture. There
were thus fair people in England, Scotland, and Ireland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
thousands of years before the invasions of Celts, Angles,
Saxons, Jutes, Norsemen, or Danes.</p>

<p>For a long period, extending over many centuries,
the migration "stream" from the Continent appears to
have been continuously flowing. The carriers of
Neolithic culture were in the main Iberians of Mediterranean
racial type&mdash;the descendants of the Azilian-Tardenoisian
peoples who used bows and arrows,
and broke up the Magdalenian civilization of Crô-Magnon
man in western and central Europe. This
race appears to have been characterized in north and
north-east Africa. "So striking", writes Professor
Elliot Smith, "is the family likeness between the early
Neolithic peoples of the British Isles and the Mediterranean
and the bulk of the population, both ancient
and modern, of Egypt and East Africa, that a description
of the bones of an Early Briton of that remote
epoch might apply in all essential details to an inhabitant
of Somaliland."<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>This proto-Egyptian (Iberian) people were of medium
stature, had long skulls and short narrow faces, and
skeletons of slight and mild build; their complexions
were as dark as those of the southern Italians in our
own day, and they had dark-brown or black hair with a
tendency to curl; the men had scanty facial hair, except
for a chin-tuft beard.</p>

<p>These brunets introduced the agricultural mode of life,
and, as they settled on the granite in south-western
England, appear to have searched for gold there, and
imported flint from the settlers on the upper chalk
formation.</p>

<p>In time Europe was invaded from Asia Minor by
increasing numbers of an Asiatic, broad-headed,
long-bearded people of similar type to those who had
filtered into Central Europe and reached Belgium and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
Denmark before Neolithic times. This type is known
as the "Armenoid race" (the "Alpine race" of some
writers). It was quite different from the long-headed
and fair Northern type and the short, brunet Mediterranean
(proto-Egyptian and Iberian) type. The Armenoid
skeletons found in the early graves indicate that
the Asiatics were a medium-sized, heavily-built people,
capable, as the large bosses on their bones indicate, of
considerable muscular development.</p>

<p>During the archæological Bronze Age these Armenoids
reached Britain in considerable numbers, and
introduced the round-barrow method of burial. They
do not appear, however, as has been indicated, to have
settled in Ireland.</p>

<p>At a later period Britain was invaded by a people
who cremated their dead. As they thus destroyed the
evidence that would have afforded us an indication of
their racial affinities, their origin is obscure.</p>

<p>While these overland migrations were in progress,
considerable numbers of peoples appear to have reached
Britain and Ireland by sea from northern and north-western
France, Portugal, and Spain. They settled
chiefly in the areas where metals and pearls were once
found or are still found. "Kitchen middens" and
megalithic remains are in Ireland mainly associated with
pearl-yielding rivers.</p>

<p>The fair Celts and the darker Celtiberians were invading
and settling in Britain before and after the Romans
first reached its southern shores. During the Roman
period, the ruling caste was mainly of south-European
type, but the Roman legions were composed of Gauls,
Germans, and Iberians, as well as Italians. No permanent
change took place in the ethnics of Britain
during the four centuries of Roman occupation. The
Armenoid broad-heads, however, became fewer: "the
disappearance", as Ripley puts it, "of the round-barrow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
men is the last event of the prehistoric period
which we are able to distinguish". The inhabitants
of the British Isles are, on the whole, long-headed.
"Highland and lowland, city or country, peasant or
philosopher, all are", says Ripley, "practically alike
in respect to this fundamental racial characteristic."
Broad-headed types are, of course, to be found, but
they are in the minority.</p>

<p>The chief source of our knowledge regarding the early
tribes or little nations of Britain and Ireland is the work
of Ptolemy, the geographer, who lived between <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 50
and 150, from which the earliest maps were compiled in
the fourth century. He shows that England, Wales,
Scotland, and Ireland were divided among a number of
peoples. The Dumnonii,<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> as has been stated, were in
possession of Devon and Cornwall, as well as of a large
area in the south-western and central lowlands of Scotland.
Near them were the Durotriges, who were also in
Ireland. Sussex was occupied by the Regni and Kent
by the Cantion. The Atrebates, the Belgæ, and the
Parisii were invaders from Gaul during the century that
followed Cæsar's invasion. The Belgæ lay across the
neck of the land between the Bristol Channel and the
Isle of Wight; the Atrebates clung to the River Thames,
while the Parisii, who gave their name to Paris, occupied
the east coast between the Wash and the Humber.
Essex was the land of the Iceni or Eceni, the tribe of
Boadicea (Boudicca). Near them were the Catuvellauni
(men who rejoiced in battle) who were probably rulers
of a league, and the Trinovantes, whose name is said to
signify "very vigorous". The most important tribe
of the north and midlands of England was the Brigantes,<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
whose sphere of influence extended to the Firth of Forth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
where they met the Votadini, who were probably kinsmen
or allies. On the north-west were the Setantii,
who appear to have been connected with the Brigantes
in England and Ireland. Cuchullin, the hero of the Red
Branch of Ulster, was originally named Setanta.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> In
south Wales the chief tribe was the Silures, whose
racial name is believed to cling to the Scilly (Silura)
Islands. They were evidently like the Dumnonii a
metal-working people. South-western Wales was
occupied by the Demetæ (the "firm folk"). In south-western
Scotland, the Selgovæ ("hunters") occupied
Galloway, their nearest neighbours being the Novantæ
of Wigtownshire. The Selgovæ may have been those
peoples known later as the Atecotti. From Fife to
southern Aberdeenshire the predominant people on the
east were the Vernicones. In north-east Aberdeenshire
were the Tæxali. To the west of these were the Vacomagi.
The Caledonians occupied the Central Highlands
from Inverness southward to Loch Lomond.
In Ross-shire were the Decantæ, a name resembling
Novantæ and Setantii. The Lugi and Smertæ (smeared
people) were farther north. The Cornavii of Caithness
and North Wales were those who occupied the "horns"
or "capes". Along the west of Scotland were peoples
called the Cerones, Creones, and Carnonacæ, or Carini,
perhaps a sheep-rearing people. The Epidii were an
Argyll tribe, whose name is connected with that of the
horse&mdash;perhaps a horse-god.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Orkney enshrines the
tribal name of the boar&mdash;perhaps that of the ancient
boar-god represented on a standing stone near Inverness
with the sun symbol above its head. The Gaelic name
one horse-stone remains in an old church tower.]
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
of the Shetlanders is "Cat". Caithness is the county
of the "Cat" people, too. Professor Watson reminds
us that the people of Sutherland are still "Cats" in
Gaelic, and that the Duke of Sutherland is referred to as
"Duke of the Cats".</p>

<p>The Picts are not mentioned by Ptolemy. They
appear to have been an agricultural and sea-faring
people who (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">c.</i> <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 300) engaged in trade and piracy.
A flood of light has been thrown on the Pictish problem
by Professor W. J. Watson, Edinburgh.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> He shows
that when Agricola invaded Scotland (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 85) the predominant
people were the Caledonians. Early in the
third century the Caledonians and Mæatæ&mdash;names
which included all the tribes north of Hadrian's
Wall&mdash;were so aggressive that Emperor Septimus
Severus organized a great expedition against them.
He pressed northward as far as the southern shore of
the Moray Firth, and, although he fought no battle, lost
50,000 men in skirmishes, &amp;c. The Caledonians and
Mæatæ rose again, and Severus was preparing a second
expedition when he died at York in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 211. His son,
Caracalla, withdrew from Scotland altogether. The
Emperor Constantius, who died at York in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 306,
had returned from an expedition, not against the Caledonians,
but against the Picts. The Picts were beginning
to become prominent. In 360 they had again to
be driven back. They had then become allies of the
Scots from Ulster, who were mentioned in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 297
by the orator Eumenius, as enemies of the Britons
in association with the Picti. Professor Watson, drawing
on Gaelic evidence, dates the first settlement of the
Scots in Argyll "about <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 180".</p>

<p>In 368 the Caledonians were, like the Verturiones, a
division of the Picts. Afterwards their tribal name disappeared.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
That the Picts and Caledonians were originally
separate peoples is made clear by the statement of
a Roman orator who said: "I do not mention the woods
and marshes of the Caledonians, the Picts, and others".
In 365 the Pecti, Saxons, Scots, and Atecotti harassed
the Britons. Thus by the fourth century the Picts had
taken the place of the Caledonians as the leading tribe,
or as the military aristocrats of a great part of Scotland,
the name of which, formerly Caledonia, came to be
Pictland, Pictavia.</p>

<p>Who then were the Picts? Professor Watson shows
that the racial name is in old Norse "Pettr", in Old
English "Peohta", and in old Scots "Pecht"<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> These
forms suggest that the original name was "Pect".
Ammianus refers to the "Pecti". In old Welsh "Peith-wyr"
means "Pict-men" and "Peith" comes from
"Pect". The derivation from the Latin "pictus"
(painted) must therefore be rejected. It should be borne
in mind in this connection that the Ancient Britons
stained their bodies with woad. The application of
the term "painted" to only one section of them seems
improbable. "Pecti", says Professor Watson, "cannot
be separated etymologically from Pictones, the
name of a Gaulish tribe on the Bay of Biscay south of
the Loire, near neighbours of the Veneti. Their name
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
shows the same variation between Pictones and Pectones.
We may therefore claim Pecti as a genuine Celtic word.
It is of the Cymric or Old British and Gaulish type, not
of the Gaelic type, for Gaelic has no initial P, while those
others have." Gildas (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">c.</i> <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 570), Bede (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">c.</i> <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 730), and
Nennius (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">c.</i> <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 800) refer to the Picts as a people from
the north of Scotland. Nennius says they occupied
Orkney first. The legends which connect the Picts
with Scythia and Hercules were based on Virgil's mention
of "picti Agathyrsi" and "picti Geloni" (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Æneid</i>
IV, 146, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Georgics</i>, II, 115) combined with the account by
Herodotus (IV, 10) of the descent of Gelonus and Agathyrsus
from Hercules. Of late origin therefore was
the Irish myth that the Picts from Scythia were called
Agathyrsi and were descended from Gelon, son of
Hercules.</p>

<p>There never were Picts in Ireland, except as visitors.
The theory about the Irish Picts arose by mistranslating
the racial name "Cruithne" as "Picts". Communities
of Cruithne were anciently settled in the four provinces
of Ireland, but Cruithne means Britons not Picts.</p>

<p><span class="small">Compare with Sardinian <i>Nuraghe</i>, page <a href="#Page_136">136</a>.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>The ancient name of Great Britain was Albion, while
Ireland was in Greek "Ierne", and in Latin "Iubernia"
(later "Hibernia"). The racial name was applied by
Pliny to Albion and Hibernia when he referred to the
island group as "Britanniæ". Ptolemy says that Albion
is "a Britannic isle" and further that Albion (England
and Scotland) was an island "belonging to the Britannic
Isles". Ireland was also a Britannic isle. It is
therefore quite clear that the Britons were regarded as the
predominant people in England, Wales, Scotland, and
Ireland, and that the verdict of history includes Ireland
in the British Isles. The Britons were P-Celts, and
their racial name "Pretan-Pritan" became in the Gaelic
language of the Q-Celts "Cruithen", plural "Cruithne".</p>

<p>In Latin the British Isles are called after their inhabitants,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
the rendering being "Britanni", while in Greek it
is "Pretannoi" or "Pretanoi". As Professor W. J.
Watson and Professor Sir J. Morris Jones, two able and
reliable philologists, have insisted, the Greek form is the
older and more correct, and the Latin form is merely an
adaptation of the Greek form.</p>

<p>In the early centuries of our era the term "Britannus"
was shortened in Latin to "Britto" plural "Brittones".
This diminutive form, which may be compared with
"Scotty" for Scotsman, became popular. In Gaelic it
originated the form "Breatain", representing "Brittones"
(Britons), which was applied to the Britons of Strathclyde,
Wales, and Cornwall, who retained their native
speech under Roman rule; in Welsh, the rendering was
"Brython". The Welsh name for Scotland became
"Prydyn". The northern people of Scotland, having
come under the sway of the Picts, were referred to as
Picts just as they became "Scots" after the tribe of
Scots rose into prominence. In this sense the Scottish
Cruithne were Picts. But the Cruithne (Britons) of
Ireland were never referred to as Picts. Modern scholars
who have mixed up Cruithne and Picts are the inventors
of the term "Irish Picts".</p>

<p>The Picts of Scotland have been traditionally associated
with the round buildings known as "brochs", which are
all built on the same plan. "Of 490 known brochs", says
Professor W. J. Watson, "Orkney and Shetland possess
145, Caithness has 150, and Sutherland 67&mdash;a total of
362. On the mainland south of Sutherland there are 10
in Ross, 6 Inverness-shire, 2 in Forfar, 1 in Stirling,
Midlothian, Selkirk, and Berwick-shires, 3 in Wigtownshire.
In the Isles there are 28 in Lewis, 10 in Harris,
30 in Skye, 1 in Raasay, and at least 5 in the isles of
Argyll. The inference is that the original seat of the
broch builders must have been in the far north, and that
their influence proceeded southwards. The masonry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
and contents of the brochs prove them to be the work
of a most capable people, who lived partly at least by
agriculture and had a fairly high standard of civilization....
The distribution of the brochs also indicate that
their occupants combined agriculture with sea-faring....
The Wigtown brochs, like the west coast ones generally,
are all close to the sea, and in exceedingly strong
positions."</p>

<p>These Scottish brochs bear a striking resemblance to
the <i>nuraghi</i> of the island of Sardinia. Both the broch
and the <i>nuraghe</i> have low doorways which "would at
once put an enemy at a disadvantage in attempting to
enter".</p>

<p>Describing the Sardinian structures, Mr. T. Eric
Peet writes:<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> "All the <i>nuraghi</i> stand in commanding
situations overlooking large tracts of country, and the
more important a position is from a strategical point of
view the stronger will be the <i>nuraghe</i> which defends it".
Ruins of villages surround these structures. "There
cannot be the least doubt", says Peet, "that in time of
danger the inhabitants drove their cattle into the fortified
enclosure, entered it themselves, and then closed the
gates."</p>

<p>In the Balearic Islands are towers called <i>talayots</i> which
"resemble rather closely", in Peet's opinion, the <i>nuraghi</i>
of Sardinia. The architecture of the <i>talayots</i>, the <i>nuraghi</i>,
and the brochs resembles that of the bee-hive tombs of
Mycenæ (pre-Hellenic Greece). There are no brochs in
Ireland. The "round towers" are of Christian origin
(between ninth and thirteenth centuries <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). A tomb
at Labbamologa, County Cork, however, resembles the
tombs of the Balearic Isles and Sardinia (Peet, <cite>Rough
Stone Monuments</cite>, pp. 43-4).</p>

<p>The Picts appear to have come to Scotland from the
country of the ancient Pictones, whose name survives in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
Poitiers (Poictiers) and the province of Poitou in
France. These Pictones were anciently rivals of the
Veneti, the chief sea-traders in Western and Northern
Europe during the pre-Roman period. We gather
from Cæsar that the Pictones espoused the cause of the
Romans when the Veneti and their allies revolted.
They and their near neighbours, the Santoni, supplied
Cæsar with ships.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> These were apparently skiffs which
were much lighter and smaller than the imposing vessels
of the Veneti. As the big vessels of the Armada were
no match for the smaller English vessels, so were the
Veneti ships no match for the skiffs of the Pictones.</p>

<p>The Picts who settled in Orkney appear to have
dominated the eastern and western Scottish sea-routes.
It is possible that they traded with Scandinavia and
imported Baltic amber. Tacitus states that the Baltic
people, who engaged in the amber trade, spoke a dialect
similar to that of Britain, worshipped the mother-goddess,
and regarded the boar as the symbol of their deity.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
Orkney, as has been noted, is derived from the old
Celtic word for boar. The boar-people of Orkney who
came under the sway of the Picts may have been related
to the amber traders.</p>

<p>The Scottish broch-people, associated in tradition with
the Picts, were notorious for their piratic habits. In
those ancient days, however, piracy was a common
occupation. The later Vikings, who seized the naval
base of Orkney for the same reason we may conclude
as did the Picts, occupied the brochs. Viking means
"pirate", as York Powell has shown. In <cite>Egil's Saga</cite>
(Chapter XXXII) the hero Bjorn "was sometimes in
Viking but sometimes on trading voyages".<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>It may be that the term <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pictus</i> with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
racial name Pecti, because the Picts had adopted the
sailor-like habit of tattoing their skins&mdash;a habit which probably
had a religious significance. Claudian, the fourth-century
Roman poet, refers to "the fading steel-wrought
figures on the dying Pict". Like the sea-faring Scots
of northern Ireland who harried the Welsh coast between
the second and fifth centuries of our era, the Picts of
Scotland had skiffs (scaphæ) with sails and twenty oars
a side. Vessels, masts, ropes, and sails were painted
a neutral tint, and the crews were attired in the same
colour. Thus "camouflaged", the Picts and Scots were
able to harry the coasts of Romanized Britain. They
appear to have turned Hadrian's wall from the sea. The
Pictish sea-faring tribes, the Keiths or Cats and the
Mæatæ, have left their names in Caithness, Inchkeith,
Dalkeith, &amp;c., and in the Isle of May, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>A glimpse of piratical operations in the first century
before the Christian era is obtained in an Irish manuscript
account of certain happenings in the reign of
King Conaire the Great of Ireland. So strict was
this monarch's rule that several lawless and discontented
persons were forced into exile.</p>

<p class="blockquote">"Among the most desperate of the outlaws were the
monarch's own foster brothers, the four sons of Dond Dess,
an important chieftain of Leinster. These refractory youths,
with a large party of followers, took to their boats and ships
and scoured the coasts of Britain and Scotland, as well as of
their own country. Having met on the sea with Ingcel, the
son of the King of Britain, who, for his misdeeds, had been
likewise banished by his own father, both parties entered
into a league, the first fruits of which were the plunder and
devastation of a great part of the British coast."</p>

</div></div>

<p>They afterwards made a descent on the coast of Ireland,
and when King Conaire returned from a visit to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
Clare, "he found the whole country before him one
sheet of fire, the plunderers having landed in his absence
and carried fire and sword wherever they went".<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>In his description of Britain, Tacitus says that the
inhabitants varied in their physical traits. Different
conclusions were drawn concerning their origin. He
thought the Caledonians were, because of their ruddy
hair and muscular limbs, of German descent, and that
the dark Silures of Wales were descendants of Iberian
colonists. He noted that the inhabitants of southern
England resembled those of Gaul.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>Later writers have expressed divergent views regarding
the ethnics of the British Isles. One theory is that
the fair Teutonic peoples, who invaded Britain during
the post-Roman period, drove the "dark Celts" westward,
and that that is the reason why in England and
Scotland the inhabitants of western areas are darker
than those in the eastern. As we have seen, however,
the early metal workers settled in the western areas
for the reason that the minerals they sought for were
located there. In south-western Scotland the inhabitants
are darker than those on the east, except in
Aberdeenshire, where there are distinctive megalithic
remains and two famous pearling rivers, the Ythan and
Ugie, as well as deposits of flint and traces of gold.</p>

<p>The people of Scotland are, on the whole, the tallest
and heaviest people in Europe. It has been suggested
that their great average stature is due to the settlement
in their country of the hardy Norsemen of the Viking
period, but this is improbable, because the average
stature of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark is lower
than that of Scotland. A distinctive feature of the
Scottish face is the high cheek-bone. The Norse
cheek-bone is distinctly flatter. It may be that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
tall Crô-Magnons, who had high cheek-bones, have
contributed to Scottish physical traits. That all the
fair peoples of Britain and Ireland are, as has been
indicated, not necessarily descendants of the fair Celts
and Anglo-Saxons is evident from the traces that have
been found of the early settlement in these islands of
the proto-Scandinavians, who introduced the Maglemosian
culture long before the introduction of the
Neolithic industry. Modern ethnologists lean to the
view that the masses of the present-day population of
Europe betray Palæolithic racial affinities. In no
country in Europe, other than our own, have there been
fewer ethnic changes. As we have seen, there were
only two or three intrusions from the Continent between
the periods when the bronze and iron industries were
introduced&mdash;that is, during about a thousand years.
The latter invasions were those of types already settled
in Britain. As in other countries, the tendency to revert
to the early types represented by the masses of the
people has not been absent in our native land. The
intrusions of energetic minorities may have caused
changes of languages and habits of life, but in time the
alien element has been absorbed.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Withal, the influences
of climate and of the diseases associated with localities
have ever been at work in eliminating the physically
unfit&mdash;that is, those individuals who cannot live in a
climate too severe for their constitutions. In large
industrial cities the short, dark types are more numerous
than the tall, fair, and large-lunged types. The latter
appear to be more suited for an open-air life.</p>

<p>"Pockets" of peoples of distinctive type are to be
found in different parts of the British Isles. In Barvas,
Lewis, and elsewhere in the Hebrides, pockets of dark
peoples of foreign appearance are reputed by theorists,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
as has been indicated, to be descendants of the sailors
of the Spanish Armada. They resemble, however, the
Fir-bolgs of Ireland and the Silures of Wales. Hertfordshire
has a dark, short people too. Galloway, the
country of the ancient Selgovæ (hunters), is noted for
its tall people. It may be that there is a Crô-Magnon
strain in Galloway, and that among the short, dark
peoples are descendants of the ancient metal workers,
including the Easterners who settled in Spain. (See
Chaps. <a href="#Page_87">IX</a> and <a href="#Page_140">XII</a>.) Beddoe thinks that the Ph&oelig;nician
type "occasionally crops up" in Cornwall.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<small>Druidism in Britain and Gaul</small></h2>

<p class="blockquote">Culture Mixing&mdash;Classical Evidence regarding Druids&mdash;Doctrine of

Oriental Milk Myths&mdash;Tree Cults and Megalithic Monuments.</p>

<p>When the question is asked "What was the religion
of the ancient Britons?" the answer generally given
is "Druidism". But such a term means little more
than "Priestism". It would perhaps be better not to
assume that the religious beliefs of our remote ancestors
were either indigenous or homogeneous, or that they
were ever completely systematized at any period or in
any district. Although certain fundamental beliefs may
have been widespread, it is clear that there existed not
a few local or tribal cults. "I swear by the gods of my
people" one hero may declare in a story, while of
another it may be told that "Coll" (the hazel) or
"Fire" was his god. Certain animals were sacred in
some districts and not in others, or were sacred to some
individuals only in a single tribe.</p>

<p>In a country like Britain, subjected in early times
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
to periodic intrusions of peoples from different areas,
the process of "culture mixing" must have been active
and constant. Imported beliefs were fused with native
beliefs, or beliefs that had assumed local features, while
local pantheons no doubt reflected local politics&mdash;the
gods of a military aristocracy being placed over the
gods of the subject people. At the same time, it does
not follow that when we find a chief deity bearing a
certain name in one district, and a different name in
another, that the religious rites and practices differed
greatly. Nor does it follow that all peoples who gave
recognition to a political deity performed the same
ceremonies or attached the same importance to all
festivals. Hunters, seafarers, and agriculturists had
their own peculiar rites, as surviving superstitions (the
beliefs of other days) clearly indicate, while the workers
in metals clung to ceremonial practices that differed
from those performed by representatives of a military
aristocracy served by the artisans.</p>

<p>Much has been written about the Druids, but it must
be confessed that our knowledge regarding them is
somewhat scanty. Classical writers have made contradictory
statements about their beliefs and ceremonies.
Pliny alone tells that they showed special reverence
for the mistletoe growing on the oak, and suggests
that the name Druid was connected with the Greek
word <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">drus</i> (an oak). Others tell that there were Druids,
Seers, and Bards in the Celtic priesthood. In his
book on divination, Cicero indicates that the Druids
had embraced the doctrines of Pythagoras, the Greek
philosopher, who was born about 586 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, including
that of the transmigration of souls.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Julius Cæsar tells
that the special province of the Druids in Gaulish
society was religion in all its aspects; they read oracles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
and instructed large numbers of the nation's youth.
Pomponius Mela<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> says the instruction was given in
caves and in secluded groves. Cæsar records that once
a year the Druids presided over a general assembly
of the Gauls at a sacred spot in the country of the
Carnutes, which was supposed to be the centre of Gaul.
It is not known whether this holy place was marked
by a mound, a grove, a stone circle, or a dolmen. The
Archdruid was chief of the priesthood. Cæsar notes
that the Germans had no Druids and paid no attention
to sacrifices.</p>

<p>Of special interest is the statement that the Druids
believed in the doctrine of Transmigration of Souls&mdash;that
is, they believed that after death the soul passed
from one individual to another, or into plants or animals
before again passing into a human being at birth.
According to Diodorus Siculus, who lived in the latter
part of the first century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, the Gauls took little
account of the end of life, believing they would come
to life after a certain term of years, entering other
bodies. He also refers to the custom of throwing letters
on the funeral pyre, so that the dead might read them.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
This suggests a belief in residence for a period in a
Hades.</p>

<p>The doctrine of Transmigration of Souls did not,
however, prevail among all Celtic peoples even in
Gaul. Valerius Maximus, writing about <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 30, says
that the Gauls were in the habit of lending sums of
money on the promise that they would be repaid in the
next world. Gaelic and Welsh literature contains little
evidence of the doctrine of Transmigration of Souls.
A few myths suggest that re-birth was a privilege of
certain specially famous individuals. Mongan, King
of Dalriada in Ulster, and the Welsh Taliessin, for
instance, were supposed to have lived for periods in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
various forms, including animal, plant, and human
forms, while other heroes were incarnations of deities.
The most persistent British belief, however, was that
after death the soul passed to an Otherworld.</p>

<p>Julius Cæsar says that Druidism was believed to have
originated in Britain.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> This cannot apply, however, to
the belief in transmigration of souls, which was shared
in common by Celts, Greeks, and Indians. According
to Herodotus, "the Egyptians are the first who have
affirmed that the soul is immortal, and that when the
body decays the soul invariably enters another body on
the point of death". The story of "The Two Brothers"
(Anpu and Bata) indicates that the doctrine was known
in Egypt. There are references in the "Book of the
Dead" to a soul becoming a lily, a golden falcon, a
ram, a crocodile, &amp;c., but this doctrine was connected,
according to Egyptologists, with the belief that souls
could assume different shapes in the Otherworld. In
India souls are supposed to pass through animal or
reptile forms only. The Greek doctrine, like the Celtic,
includes plant forms. Certain African tribes believe in
the transmigration of souls.</p>

<p>In ancient Britain and Ireland the belief obtained, as
in Greece and elsewhere, that there was an Underworld
Paradise and certain Islands of the Blest (in Gaelic
called "The Land of Youth", "The Plain of Bliss",
&amp;c.) The Underworld was entered through caves, wells,
rivers or lakes, or through the ocean cavern from which
the moon arose. There are references in Scottish folk-tales
to "The Land-Under-Waves", and to men and
women entering the Underworld through a "fairy"
mound, and seeing the dead plucking fruit and reaping
grain as in the Paradise of the Egyptian god Osiris. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
is evident that Fairyland was originally a Paradise,
and the fairy queen an old mother goddess. There are
references in Welsh to as gloomy an Underworld as the
Babylonian one. "In addition to <i lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">Annwfn</i>, a term
which", according to the late Professor Anwyl, "seems
to mean the 'Not-world', we have other names for the
world below, such as <i lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">anghar</i>, 'the loveless place';
<i lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">difant</i>, the unrimmed place (whence the modern Welsh
word <i lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">difancoll</i>, 'lost for ever'); <i lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">affwys</i>, the abyss; <i lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">affan</i>,
'the land invisible'." In a Welsh poem a bard speaks
of the Otherworld as "the cruel prison of earth, the
abode of death, the loveless land".<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>The Border Ballads of Scotland contain references to
the Fairyland Paradise of the Underworld, to the islands
or continent of Paradise, and to the dark Otherworld of
the grave in which the dead lie among devouring worms.</p>

<p>In one Celtic Elysium, known to the Welsh and Irish,
the dead feast on pork as do the heroes in the Paradise
of the Scandinavian god Odin. There is no trace in
Scotland of a belief or desire to reach a Paradise in
which the pig was eaten. The popularity of the apple
as the fruit of longevity was, however, widespread. It
is uncertain when the beliefs connected with it were
introduced into England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland.
As they were similar to those connected with the hazel-nut,
the acorn, the rowan, &amp;c., there may have simply
been a change of fruit rather than a religious change,
except in so far as new ceremonies may have been
associated with the cultivated apple tree.</p>

<p>A Gaelic story tells of a youth who in Paradise held a
fragrant golden apple in his right hand. "A third part
of it he would eat and still, for all he consumed, never
a whit would it be diminished." As long as he ate the
apple "nor age nor dimness could affect him". Paradise
was in Welsh and Gaelic called "Apple land".<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
Its "tree of life" always bore ripe fruit and fresh blossoms.
One of the Irish St. Patrick legends pictures a
fair youth coming from the south<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> clad in crimson
mantle and yellow shirt, carrying a "double armful of
round yellow-headed nuts and of most beautiful golden-yellow
apples". There are stories, too, about the hazel
with its "good fruit", and of holy fire being taken from
this tree, and withal a number of hazel place-names that
probably indicate where sacred hazel groves once existed.
Hallowe'en customs connected with apples and nuts are
evidently relics of ancient religious beliefs and ceremonies.</p>

<p>The Druids are reported by Pliny (as has been stated)
to have venerated the mistletoe, especially when it was
found growing on an oak. But the popular parasitic
plant is very rarely found associated with this tree.
In France and England it grows chiefly on firs and
pines or on apple trees, but never on the plane, beech,
or birch.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> It is therefore doubtful if the name Druid
was derived from the root <i>dru</i> which is found in the
Greek word <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">drus</i> (oak). In Gaelic the Druids are "wise
men" who read oracles, worked spells, controlled the
weather, and acted as intercessors between the gods and
men. Like the dragon-slayers of romance, they understood
"the language of birds", and especially that of
the particular bird associated with the holy tree of a
cult. One sacred bird was the wren. According to Dr.
Whitley Stokes the old Celtic names of wren and Druid
were derived from the root <i>dreo</i>, which is cognate with
the German word <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">treu</i> and the English <i>true</i>. The Druid
was therefore, as one who understood the language of
the wren, a soothsayer, a truth-sayer&mdash;a revealer of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
divine truth. A judgment pronounced by Druid or
king was supposed to be inspired by the deity. It was
essentially a divine decree. The judge wore round his
neck the symbol of the deity. "When what he said
was true, it was roomy for his neck; when false, it was
narrow." This symbol according to <cite>Cormac`s Glossary</cite>
was called <i>sin</i> (sheen). Some seers derived their power
to reveal the truth by tasting the blood or juice of a holy
animal or reptile, or, like Thomas the Rhymer, by eating
of an apple plucked from the tree of life in the Paradise
of Fairyland. In an old ballad it is told that when
Thomas was carried off to the Underworld by the fairy
queen he was given an inspiring apple that made him a
"truth-sayer" (a prophet).</p>

<div class="line i1">  It will give thee the tongue that can never lee (lie)."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>"True Thomas" was "Druid Thomas".</p>

<p>An interesting reference to Druidism is found in a
Gaelic poem supposed to have been written by St.
Columba, in which the missionary says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">The voices of birds I do not reverence,</div>
<div class="line">Nor sneezing, nor any charm in this wide world.</div>
<div class="line">Christ, the Son of God, is my Druid.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There are Gaelic stories about Druids who read the
omens of the air and foretell the fates of individuals at
birth, fix the days on which young warriors should take
arms, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales not only
trees and birds were reverenced, but also standing stones,
which are sometimes referred to even in modern Gaelic
as "stones of worship". Some stories tell of standing
stones being transformed into human beings when struck
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
by a magician's wand. The wand in one story is possessed
by a "wise woman". Other traditions relate
that once a year the stones become maidens who visit a
neighbouring stream and bathe in it. A version of this
myth survives in Oxfordshire. According to Tacitus
there were on the island of Mona (Anglesea), which was
a centre of religious influence, not only Druids, but
"women in black attire like Furies"&mdash;apparently priestesses.
As has been noted, a large number of dolmens
existed on Mona, in which there were also "groves
devoted to inhuman superstitions".<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>The early Christian writers refer to the "worship of
stones" in Ireland. In the seventh century the Council
at Rouen denounced all those who offer vows to trees,
or wells, or stones, as they would at altars, or offer
candles or gifts, as if any divinity resided there capable
of conferring good or evil. The Council at Arles (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
452) and the Council at Toledo (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 681) dealt with
similar pagan practices. That sacred stones were associated
with sacred trees is indicated in a decree of an
early Christian Council held at Nantes which exhorts
"bishops and their servants to dig up and remove and
hide in places where they cannot be found those stones
which in remote and woody places are still worshipped
and where vows are still made". This worship of stones
was in Britain, or at any rate in part of England, connected
with the worship of the heavenly bodies. A
statute of the time of King Canute forbids the barbarous
adoration of the sun and moon, fire, fountains, stones,
and all kinds of trees and wood. In the Confession
attributed to St. Patrick, the Irish are warned that all
those who adore the sun shall perish eternally. <i>Cormac's</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
<i>Glossary</i> explains that <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Indelba</i> signified <i>Images</i> and
that this name was applied to the altars of certain idols.
"They (the pagans) were wont to carve on them the
forms of the elements they adored: for example, the
figure of the sun." Irish Gaels swore by "the sun,
moon, water, and air, day and night, sea and land". In
a Scottish story some warriors lift up a portion of earth
and swear on it. The custom of swearing on weapons
was widespread in these islands. In ancient times
people swore by what was holiest to them.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>One of the latest references to pagan religious customs
is found in the records of Dingwall Presbytery dating
from 1649 to 1678. In the Parish of Gairloch, Ross-shire,
bulls were sacrificed, oblations of milk were poured
on the hills, wells were adored, and chapels were "circulated"&mdash;the
worshippers walked round them sunwise.
Those who intended to set out on journeys thrust their
heads into a hole in a stone.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> If a head entered the hole,
it was believed the man would return; if it did not, his
luck was doubtful. The reference to "oblations of milk"
is of special interest, because milk was offered to the
fairies. A milk offering was likewise poured daily into
the "cup" of a stone known as Clach-na-Gruagach (the
stone of the long-haired one). A bowl of milk was, in
the Highlands, placed beside a corpse, and, after burial
took place, either outside the house door or at the grave.
The conventionalized Azilian human form is sometimes
found to be depicted by small "cups" on boulders or
rocks. Some "cups" were formed by "knocking"
with a small stone for purposes of divination. The
"cradle stone" at Burghead is a case in point. It is
dealt with by Sir Arthur Mitchell (<cite>The Past in the
Present</cite>, pp. 263-5), who refers to other "cup-stones"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
that were regarded as being "efficacious in cases of
barrenness". In some hollowed stones Highland
parents immersed children suspected of being changelings.</p>

<p>A flood of light has been thrown on the origin of
Druidism by Siret,<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> the discoverer of the settlements of
Easterners in Spain which have been dealt with in an
earlier chapter. He shows that the colonists were an
intensely religious people, who introduced the Eastern
Palm-tree cult and worshipped a goddess similar to the
Egyptian Hathor, a form of whom was Nut. After they
were expelled from Spain by a bronze-using people, the
refugees settled in Gaul and Italy, carrying with them
the science and religious beliefs and practices associated
with Druidism. Commercial relations were established
between the Etruscans, the peoples of Gaul and the south
of Spain, and with the Ph&oelig;nicians of Tyre and Carthage
during the archæological Early Iron Age. Some of the
megalithic monuments of North Africa were connected
with this later drift.</p>

<p>The goddess Hathor of Egypt was associated with
the sycamore fig which exudes a milk-like fluid, with
a sea-shell, with the sky (as Nut she was depicted as
a star-spangled woman), and with the primeval cow.
The tree cult was introduced into Rome. The legend
of the foundation of that city is closely associated with
the "milk"-yielding fig tree, under which the twins
Romulus and Remus were nourished by the wolf. The
fig-milk was regarded as an elixir and was given by the
Greeks to newly born children.</p>

<p>Siret shows that the ancient name of the Tiber was
Rumon, which was derived from the root signifying
milk. It was supposed to nourish the earth with
terrestrial milk. From the same root came the name of
Rome. The ancient milk-providing goddess of Rome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
was Deva Rumina. Offerings of milk instead of wine
were made to her. The starry heavens were called
"Juno's milk" by the Romans, and "Hera's milk" by
the Greeks, and the name "Milky Way" is still retained.</p>

<p>The milk tree of the British Isles is the hazel. It
contains a milky fluid in the green nut, which Highland
children of a past generation regarded as a fluid that
gave them strength. Nut-milk was evidently regarded in
ancient times as an elixir like fig-milk.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> There is a great
deal of Gaelic lore connected with the hazel. In Keating's
<cite>History of Ireland</cite> (Vol. I, section 12) appears the
significant statement, "Coll (the hazel) indeed was god
to MacCuil". "Coll" is the old Gaelic word for hazel;
the modern word is "Call". "Calltuinn" (Englished
"Calton") is a "hazel grove". There are Caltons in
Edinburgh and Glasgow and well-worn forms of the
ancient name elsewhere. In the legends associated with
the Irish Saint Maedóg is one regarding a dried-up
stick of hazel which "sprouted into leaf and blossom
and good fruit". It is added that this hazel "endures
yet (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 624), a fresh tree, undecayed, unwithered, nut-laden
yearly".<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The sacred hazel was supposed to be
impregnated with the substance of life. Another reference
is made to <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Coll na nothar</i> ("hazel of the wounded").
Hazel-nuts of longevity, as well as apples of longevity,
were supposed to grow in the Gaelic Paradise. In a St.
Patrick legend a youth comes from the south ("south"
is Paradise and "north" is hell) carrying "a double armful
of round yellow-headed nuts and of beautiful golden-yellow
apples". Dr. Joyce states that the ancient Irish
"attributed certain druidical or fairy virtues to the yew,
the hazel, and the quicken or rowan tree", and refers to
"innumerable instances in tales, poems, and other old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
records, in such expressions as 'Cruachan of the fair
hazels', 'Derry-na-nath, on which fair-nutted hazels are
constantly found'.... Among the blessings a good
king brought on the land was plenty of hazel-nuts:&mdash;'O'Berga
(the chief) for whom the hazels stoop', 'Each
hazel is rich from the hero'." Hazel-nuts were like the
figs and dates of the Easterners, largely used for food.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>Important evidence regarding the milk elixir and the
associated myths and doctrines is preserved in the
ancient religious literature of India and especially in
the <i lang="hi" xml:lang="hi">Mahá-bhárata</i>. The Indian Hathor is the cow-mother
Surabhi, who sprang from Amrita (Soma) in the
mouth of the Grandfather (Brahma). A single jet of
her milk gave origin to "Milky Ocean". The milk
"mixing with the water" appeared as foam, and was
the only nourishment of the holy men called "Foam
drinkers". Divine milk was also obtained from "milk-yielding
trees", which were the "children" of one of
her daughters. These trees included nut trees. Another
daughter was the mother of birds of the parrot species
(oracular birds). In the Vedic poems <i lang="hi" xml:lang="hi">soma</i>, a drink
prepared from a plant, is said to have been mixed with
milk and honey, and mention is made of "<i lang="hi" xml:lang="hi">Su-soma</i>"
("river of Soma"). <i lang="hi" xml:lang="hi">Madhu</i> (mead) was a drink identified
with <i lang="hi" xml:lang="hi">soma</i>, or milk and honey.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>There are rivers of mead in the Celtic Paradise.
Certain trees are in Irish lore associated with rivers that
were regarded as sacred. These were not necessarily
milk-yielding trees. In Gaul the plane tree took the
place of the southern fig tree. The elm tree in Ireland
and Scotland was similarly connected with the ancient
milk cult. One of the old names for new milk, found in
"Cormac's Glossary", is <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">lemlacht</i>, the later form of
which is <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">leamhnacht</i>. From the same root (<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">lem</i>) comes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">leamh</i>, the name of the elm. The River Laune in Killarney
is a rendering of the Gaelic name <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">leamhain</i>,
which in Scotland is found as Leven, the river that
gave its name to the area known as Lennox (ancient
<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Leamhna</i>). Milk place-names in Ireland include "new
milk lake" (Lough Alewnaghta) in Galway, "which",
Joyce suggests, "may have been so called from the
softness of its water". A mythological origin of the
name is more probable. Wounds received in battle
were supposed to be healed in baths of the milk of white
hornless cows.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> In Irish blood-covenant ceremonies
new milk, blood, and wine were mixed and drunk by
warriors.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> As late as the twelfth century a rich man's
child was in Ireland immersed immediately after birth
in new milk.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> In Rome, in the ninth century, at the
Easter-eve baptism the chalice was filled "not with
wine but with milk and honey, that they may understand
... that they have entered already upon the
promised land".<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>The beliefs associated with the apple, rowan, hazel,
and oak trees were essentially the same. These trees
provided the fruits of longevity and knowledge, or the
wine which was originally regarded as an elixir that
imparted new life and inspired those who drank it to
prophecy<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>. The oak provided acorns which were eaten.
Although it does not bear red berries like the rowan,
a variety of the oak is greatly favoured by the insect
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Kermes</i>, "which yields a scarlet dye nearly equal to
cochineal, and is the 'scarlet' mentioned in Scripture".
This fact is of importance as the early peoples attached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
much value to colour and especially to red, the colour of
life blood. Withal, acorn-cups "are largely imported
from the Levant for the purposes of tanning, dyeing,
and making ink".<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> A seafaring people like the ancient
Britons must have tanned the skins used for boats so as
to prevent them rotting on coming into contact with
water. Dr. Joyce writes of the ancient Irish in this
connection, "Curraghs<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> or wicker-boats were often
covered with leather. A jacket of hard, tough, tanned
leather was sometimes worn in battle as a protecting
corslet. Bags made of leather, and often of undressed
skins, were pretty generally used to hold liquids. There
was a sort of leather wallet or bag called <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">crioll</i>, used like
a modern travelling bag, to hold clothes and other soft
articles. The art of tanning was well understood in
ancient Ireland. The name for a tanner was <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">sudaire</i>,
which is still a living word. Oak bark was employed,
and in connection with this use was called <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">coirteach</i>
(Latin, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cortex</i>)." The oak-god protected seafarers by
making their vessels sea-worthy.</p>

<p>Mistletoe berries may have been regarded as milk-berries
because of their colour, and the ceremonial cutting
of the mistletoe with the golden sickle may well
have been a ceremony connected with the fertilization
of trees practised in the East. The mistletoe was reputed
to be an "all-heal", although really it is useless for
medicinal purposes.</p>

<p>That complex ideas were associated with deities imported
into this country, the history of which must be
sought for elsewhere, is made manifest when we find
that, in the treeless Outer Hebrides, the goddess known
as the "maiden queen" has her dwelling in a tree and
provides the "milk of knowledge" from a sea-shell. She
could not possibly have had independent origin in Scotland.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
Her history is rooted in ancient Egypt, where
Hathor, the provider of the milk of knowledge and
longevity, was, as has been indicated, connected with
the starry sky (the Milky Way), a sea-shell, the milk-yielding
sycamore fig, and the primeval cow.</p>

<p>The cult animal of the goddess was in Egypt the star-spangled
cow; in Troy it was a star-spangled sow<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>.
The cult animal of Rome was the wolf which suckled
Romulus and Remus. In Crete the local Zeus was
suckled, according to the belief of one cult, by a horned
sheep<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>, and according to another cult by a sow. There
were various cult animals in ancient Scotland, including
the tabooed pig, the red deer milked by the fairies, the
wolf, and the cat of the "Cat" tribes in Shetland, Caithness,
&amp;c. The cow appears to have been sacred to
certain peoples in ancient Britain and Ireland. It would
appear, too, that there was a sacred dog in Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>It is evident that among the Eastern beliefs anciently
imported into the British Isles were some which still
bear traces of the influence of cults and of culture
mixing. That religious ideas of Egyptian and Babylonian
origin were blended in this country there can
be little doubt, for the Gaelic-speaking peoples, who
revered the hazel as the Egyptians revered the sycamore,
regarded the liver as the seat of life, as did the Babylonians,
and not the heart, as did the Egyptians. In
translations of ancient Gaelic literature "liver" is always
rendered as "vitals".</p>

<p>Cult Animals and "Wonder Beasts" (dragons or makaras) on Scottish<br />

</div></div>

<p>It is of special interest to note that Siret has found
evidence to show that the Tree Cult of the Easterners
was connected with the early megalithic monuments.
The testimony of tradition associates the stone circles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
&amp;c., with the Druids. "We are now obliged", he
writes<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>, "to go back to the theory of the archæologists
of a hundred years ago who attributed the megalithic
monuments to the Druids. The instinct of our predecessors
has been more penetrating than the scientific
analysis which has taken its place." In Gaelic, as will
be shown, the words for a sacred grove and the shrine
within a grove are derived from the same root <i>nem</i>.
(See also <a href="#Page_87">Chapter IX</a> in this connection.)</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<small>The Lore of Charms</small></h2>

<p class="blockquote">The Meaning of "Luck"&mdash;Symbolism of Charms&mdash;Colour Symbolism&mdash;Death
as a Change&mdash;Food and Charms for the Dead&mdash;The Lucky
Pearl&mdash;Pearl Goddess&mdash;Moon as "Pearl of Heaven"&mdash;Sky Goddess connected

Substance" in Amber, Jet, Coral, &amp;c.&mdash;Enamel as Substitute for Coral,
&amp;c.&mdash;Precious Metal and Precious Stones&mdash;Goddess of Life and Law&mdash;Pearl
as a Standard of Value in Gaelic Trade.</p>

<p>Our ancestors were greatly concerned about their
luck. They consulted oracles to discover what luck
was in store for them. To them luck meant everything
they most desired&mdash;good health, good fortune, an
abundant food supply, and protection against drowning,
wounds in battle, accidents, and so on. Luck was
ensured by performing ceremonies and wearing charms.
Some ceremonies were performed round sacred bon-fires
(bone fires), when sacrifices were made, at holy
wells, in groves, or in stone circles. Charms included
precious stones, coloured stones, pearls, and articles
of silver, gold, or copper of symbolic shape, or bearing
an image or inscription. Mascots, "lucky pigs", &amp;c.,
are relics of the ancient custom of wearing charms.</p>

<p>The colour as well as the shape of a charm revealed
its particular influence. Certain colours are still regarded
as being lucky or unlucky ("yellow is forsaken"
some say). In ancient times colours meant much to
the Britons, as they did to other peoples. This fact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
is brought out in many tales and customs. A Welsh
story, for instance, which refers to the appearance of
supernatural beings attired in red and blue, says, "The
red on the one part signifies burning, and the blue
on the other signifies coldness".<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>On their persisting belief in luck were based the
religious ideas and practices of the ancient Britons.
Their chief concern was to protect and prolong life in
this world and in the next. When death came it
was regarded as "a change". The individual was
supposed either to fall asleep, or to be transported in
the body to Paradise, or to assume a new form. In
Scottish Gaelic one can still hear the phrase <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">chaochail e</i>
("he changed") used to signify that "he died".<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> But
after death charms were as necessary as during life.
As in Aurignacian times, luck-charms in the form of
necklaces, armlets, &amp;c., were placed in the graves of
the dead by those who used flint, or bronze, or iron
to shape implements and weapons. The dead had to
receive nourishment, and clay vessels are invariably
found in ancient graves, some of which contain dusty
deposits. The writer has seen at Fortrose a deposit in
one of these grave urns, which a medical man identified
as part of the skeleton of a bird.</p>

<p>Necklaces of shells, of wild animals' teeth, and ornaments
of ivory found in Palæolithic graves or burial
caves were connected with the belief that they contained
the animating influence or "life substance" of the
mother goddess. In later times the pearl found in
the shell was regarded as being specially sacred.</p>

<p>Venus (Aphrodite) is, in one of her phases, the personification
of a pearl, and is lifted from the sea seated
on a shell. As a sky deity she was connected with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
the planet that bears her name<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> and also with the moon.
The ancients connected the moon with the pearl. In
some languages the moon is the "pearl of heaven".
Dante, in his <cite>Inferno</cite>, refers to the moon as "the
eternal pearl". One of the Gaelic names for a pearl
is <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">neamhnuid</i>. The root is <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">nem</i> of <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">neamh</i>, and <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">neamh</i>
is "heaven", so that the pearl is "a heavenly thing"
in Gaelic, as in other ancient languages. It was associated
not only with the sky goddess but with the
sacred grove in which the goddess was worshipped.
The Gaulish name <i>nemeton</i>, of which the root is likewise
<i>nem</i>, means "shrine in a grove". In early Christian
times in Ireland the name was applied as <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">nemed</i>
to a chapel, and in Scottish place-names<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> it survives
in the form of <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">neimhidh</i>, "church-land", the Englished
forms of which are <i>Navity</i>, near Cromarty, <i>Navaty</i> in
Fife, "Rosneath", formerly Rosneveth (the promontory
of the <i>nemed</i>), "Dalnavie" (dale of the <i>nemed</i>),
"Cnocnavie" (hillock of the <i>nemed</i>), Inchnavie (island
of the <i>nemed</i>), &amp;c. The Gauls had a <i>nemetomarus</i>
("great shrine"), and when in Roman times a shrine
was dedicated to Augustus it was called <i>Augustonemeton</i>.
The root <i>nem</i> is in the Latin word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nemus</i> (a grove).
It was apparently because the goddess of the grove
was the goddess of the sky and of the pearl, and the
goddess of battle as well as the goddess of love, that
Julius Cæsar made a thanksgiving offering to Venus
in her temple at Rome of a corslet of British pearls.</p>

<p>The Irish goddess Nemon was the spouse of the war
god Neit. A Roman inscription at Bath refers to the
British goddess N&#277;m&#277;t&#335;na. The Gauls had a goddess
of similar name. In Galatia, Asia Minor, the particular
tree connected with the sky goddess was the oak, as is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
shown by the name of their religious centre which
was <i>Dru-nemeton</i> ("Oak-grove"). It will be shown
in a later chapter that the sacred tree was connected
with the sky and the deities of the sky, with the sacred
wells and rivers, with the sacred fish, and with the fire,
the sun, and lightning. Here it may be noted that the
sacred well is connected with the holy grove, the sky, the
pearl, and the mother goddess in the Irish place-name
<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Neamhnach</i> (Navnagh),<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> applied to the well from which
flows the stream of the Nith. The well is thus, like the
pearl, "the heavenly one". The root <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">nem</i> of <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">neamh</i>
(heaven) is found in the name of St. Brendan's mother,
who was called <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Neamhnat</i> (Navnat), which means
"little" or "dear heavenly one". In <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">neamhan</i> ("raven"
and "crow") the bird form of the deity is enshrined.</p>

<p>Owing to its connection with the moon, the pearl
was supposed to shine by night. The same peculiarity
was attributed to certain sacred stones, to coral, jade,
&amp;c., and to ivory. Munster people perpetuate the
belief that "at the bottom of the lower lake of Killarney
there is a diamond of priceless value, which sometimes
shines so brightly that on certain nights the light bursts
forth with dazzling brilliancy through the dark waters".<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
Night-shining jewels are known in Scotland. One is
suppose to shine on Arthur's Seat, Edinburgh, and
another on the north "souter" of the Cromarty Firth.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
Another sacred stone connected with the goddess was
the onyx, which in ancient Gaelic is called <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">nem</i>.
Night-shining jewels are referred to in the myths of
Greece, Arabia, Persia, India, China, Japan, &amp;c.
Laufer has shown that the Chinese received their lore
about the night-shining diamond from "Fu-lin" (the
Byzantine Empire).<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
The ancient pearl-fishers spread their pearl-lore far
and wide. It is told in more than one land that pearls
are formed by dew-drops from the sky. Pliny says the
dew-or rain-drops fall into the shells of the pearl-oyster
when it gapes.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> In modern times the belief is
that pearls are the congealed tears of the angels. In
Greece the pearl was called <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">margaritoe</i>, a name which
survives in Margaret, anciently the name of a goddess.
The old Persian name for pearl is <i>margan</i>, which
signifies "life giver". It is possible that this is the
original meaning of the name of Morgan le Fay (Morgan
the Fairy), who is remembered as the sister of King
Arthur, and of the Irish goddess Morrigan, usually
Englished as "Sea-queen" (the sea as the source of
life), or "great queen". At any rate, Morgan le Fay
and the Morrigan closely resemble one another. In
Italian we meet with Fata Morgana.</p>

<p>The old Persian word for coral is likewise <i>margan</i>.
Coral was supposed to be a tree, and it was regarded
as the sea-tree of the sea and sky goddess. Amber
was connected, too, with the goddess. In northern
mythology, amber, pearls, precious stones, and precious
metals were supposed to be congealed forms of the tears
of the goddess Freyja, the Venus of the Scandinavians.</p>

<p>Amber, like pearls, was sacred to the mother goddess
because her life substance (the animating principle) was
supposed to be concentrated in it. The connection
between the precious or sacred amber and the goddess
and her cult animal is brought out in a reference made
by Tacitus to the amber collectors and traders on the
southern shore of the Baltic. These are the Æstyans,
who, according to Tacitus, were costumed like the
Swedes, but spoke a language resembling the dialect
of the Britons. "They worship", the historian records,
"the mother of the gods. The figure of a wild boar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
is the symbol of their superstition; and he who has
that emblem about him thinks himself secure even in
the thickest ranks of the enemy without any need of
arms or any other mode of defence."<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> The animal of
the amber goddess was thus the boar, which was the
sacred animal of the Celtic tribe, the Iceni of ancient
Britain, which under Boadicea revolted against Roman
rule. The symbol of the boar (remembered as the
"lucky pig") is found on ancient British armour. On
the famous Witham shield there are coral and enamel.
Three bronze boar symbols found in a field at Hounslow
are preserved in the British Museum. In the same
field was found a solar-wheel symbol. "The boar
frequently occurs in British and Gaulish coins of the
period, and examples have been found as far off as
Gurina and Transylvania."<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Other sacred cult animals
were connected with the goddess by those people who
fished for pearls and coral or searched for sacred
precious stones or precious metals.</p>

<p>At the basis of the ancient religious system that connected
coral, shells, and pearls with the mother goddess
of the sea, wells, rivers, and lakes, was the belief that all
life had its origin in water. Pearls, amber, marsh plants,
and animals connected with water were supposed to
be closely associated with the goddess who herself had
had her origin in water. Tacitus tells that the Baltic
worshippers of the mother goddess called amber <i>glesse</i>.
According to Pliny<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> it was called <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">glessum</i> by the Germans,
and he tells that one of the Baltic islands famous
for its amber was named <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Glessaria</i>. The root is the
Celtic word <i>glas</i>, which originally meant "water" and
especially life-giving water. Boece (<i>Cosmographie</i>,
Chapter XV) tells that in Scotland the belief prevailed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
that amber was generated of sea-froth. It thus had its
origin like Aphrodite. <i>Glas</i> is now a colour term in
Welsh and Gaelic, signifying green or grey, or even
a shade of blue. It was anciently used to denote
vigour, as in the term <i>Gaidheal glas</i> ("the vigorous
Gael" or "the ambered Gael", the vigour being derived
from the goddess of amber and the sea); and in the
Latinized form of the old British name Cuneglasos,
which like the Irish Conglas signified "vigorous hound".<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
Here the sacred hound figures in place of the sacred
boar.</p>

<p>From the root <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">glas</i> comes also <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">glaisin</i>, the Gaelic name
for woad, the blue dyestuff with which ancient Britons
and Gaels stained or tattooed their bodies with figures
of sacred animals or symbols,<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> apparently to secure
protection as did those who had the boar symbol on
their armour. For the same reason Cuchullin, the
Irish Achilles, wore pearls in his hair, and the Roman
Emperor Caligula had a pearl collar on his favourite
horse. Ice being a form of water is in French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">glacé</i>,
which also means "glass". When glass beads were
first manufactured they were regarded, like amber, as
depositories of "life substance" from the water goddess
who, as sky goddess, was connected with sun and fire.
Her fire melted the constituents of glass into liquid
form, and it hardened like jewels and amber. These
beads were called "adder stones" (Welsh <i lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">glain neidre</i>
and "Druid's gem" or "glass"&mdash;in Welsh <i lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">Gleini na
Droedh</i> and in Gaelic <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Glaine nan Druidhe</i>).</p>

<p>A special peculiarity about amber is that when rubbed
vigorously it attracts or lifts light articles. That is why
it is called in Persian Kahruba (<i>Kah</i>, straw; <i>ruba</i>, to
lift). This name appears in modern French as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carabé</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
(yellow amber). In Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese it
is <i>carabe</i>. No doubt the early peoples, who gathered
Adriatic and Baltic amber and distributed it and its lore
far and wide, discovered this peculiar quality in the
sacred substance. In Britain, jet was used in the same
way as amber for luck charms and ornaments. Like
amber it becomes negatively electric by friction. Bede
appears to have believed that jet was possessed of special
virtue. "When heated", he says, "it drives away
serpents."<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> The Romans regarded jet as a depository
of supernatural power<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> and used it for ornaments. Until
comparatively recently jet was used in Scotland as a
charm against witchcraft, the evil eye, &amp;c. "A ring
of hard black schistus found in a cairn in the parish of
Inchinan", writes a local Scottish historian, "has performed,
if we believe report, many astonishing cures."<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
Albertite, which, like jet and amber, attracts light
articles when vigorously rubbed, was made into ornaments.
It takes on a finer lustre than jet but loses it
sooner.</p>

<p>The fact that jet, albertite, and other black substances
were supposed to be specially efficacious for protecting
black horses and cattle is of peculiar interest. Hathor,
the cow goddess of Egypt, had a black as well as a
white form as goddess of the night sky and death.
She was the prototype of the black Aphrodite (Venus).
In Scotland a black goddess (the <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">nigra dea</i> in Adamnan's
<cite>Life of Columba</cite>) was associated with Loch Lochy.</p>

<p>The use of coral as a sacred substance did not begin
in Britain until the knowledge of iron working was
introduced. Coral is not found nearer than the Mediterranean.
The people who first brought it to Britain
must have received it and the beliefs attached to it from
the Mediterranean area. Before reaching Britain they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
had begun to make imitation coral. The substitute was
enamel, which required for its manufacture great skill
and considerable knowledge, furnaces capable of generating
an intense heat being necessary. It is inconceivable
that so expensive a material could have been
produced except for religious purposes. The warriors
apparently believed that coral and its substitutes protected
them as did amber and the boar symbol of the
mother goddess.</p>

<p>At first red enamel was used as a substitute for red
coral, but ultimately blue, yellow, and white enamels
were produced. Sometimes we find, as at Traprain in
Scotland, that silver took the place of white enamel.
It is possible that blue enamel was a substitute for
turquoise and lapis lazuli, the precious stones associated
with the mother goddesses of Hathor type, and that
yellow and white enamels were substitutes for yellow
and white amber. The Greeks called white amber
"electrum". The symbolism of gold and silver links
closely with that of amber. Possibly the various sacred
substances and their substitutes were supposed to protect
different parts of the body. As much is suggested,
for instance, by the lingering belief that amber protects
and strengthens the eyes. The solar cult connected the
ear and the ear-ring with the sun, which was one of the
"eyes" of the world-deity, the other "eye" being the
moon. When human ears were pierced, the blood
drops were offered to the sun-god. Sailors of a past
generation clung to the ancient notion that gold ear-rings
exercised a beneficial influence on their eyes.
Not only the colours of luck objects, but their shapes
were supposed to ensure luck. The Swashtika symbol,
the U-form, the S-form, and 8-form symbols, the spiral,
the leaf-shaped and equal-limbed crosses, &amp;c., were
supposed to "attract" and "radiate" the influence of
the deity. Thus Buddhists accumulate religious "merit"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
not only by fasting and praying, but by making collections
of jewels and symbols.</p>

<p>In Britain, as in other countries, the deity was closely
associated as an influence with law. A Roman inscription
on a slab found at Carvoran refers to the mother
goddess "poising life and laws in a balance". This
was Ceres, whose worship had been introduced during
the Roman period, but similar beliefs were attached to
the ancient goddesses of Britain. Vows were taken
over objects sacred to her, and sacred objects were used
as mediums of exchange. In old Gaelic, for instance,
a jewel or pearl was called a <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">set</i>; in modern Gaelic it is
<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">sed</i> (pronounced <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">shade</i>). A <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">set</i> (pearl) was equal in
value to an ounce of gold and to a cow. An ounce of
gold was therefore a <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">set</i> and a cow was a <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">set</i>, too.
Three <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">sets</i> was the value of a bondmaid. The value of
three sets was one <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">cumal</i>. Another standard of value
was a sack of corn (<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">miach</i>).<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>The value attached to gold and pearls was originally
magical. Jewels and precious metals were searched for
for to bring wearers "luck"&mdash;that is, everything their
hearts desired. The search for these promoted trade,
and the <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">sets</i> were used as a standard of value between
traders. Thus not only religious systems, but even
the early systems of trade were closely connected with
the persistent belief in luck and the deity who was the
source of luck.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>The ancient superstitions dealt with in the previous
chapter afford us glimpses of the world in which our
ancestors lived, and some idea of the incentives that
caused them to undertake long and perilous journeys in
search of articles of religious value. They were as
greatly concerned as are their descendants about their
health and their fate. Everything connected with the
deity, or possessing, as was believed, the influence of
the deity, was valuable as a charm or as medicine.
The mistletoe berry was a famous medicine because it
was the fruit of a parasite supposed to contain the "life
substance" of a powerful deity. It was an "All Heal"
or "Cure All",<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> yet it was a quack medicine and quite
useless. Red earth was "blood earth"; it contained
the animating principle too. Certain herbs were supposed
to be curative. Some herbs were, and in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
course of time their precise qualities were identified.
But many of them continued in use, although quite
useless, because of the colour of their berries, the shape
of their leaves, or the position in which they grew. If
one red-berried plant was "lucky" or curative, all red-berried
plants shared in its reputation. It was because
of the lore attached to colours that dusky pearls were
preferred to white pearls, just as in Ceylon yellow pearls
are chiefly favoured because yellow is the sacred colour
of the Buddhists. Richard of Cirencester,<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> referring to
Bede, says that British pearls are "often of the best
kind and of every colour: that is, red, purple, violet,
green, but principally white".</p>

<p>In the lore of plants, in religious customs, including
burial customs, and in beliefs connected with the seasons,
weather, and sacred sites, there are traces of a doctrine
based on the belief that good or bad influences "flowed"
from the cardinal points, just as good or bad influences
"flowed" from gems, metals, wood, and water. When,
for instance, certain herbs were pulled from the ground,
it was important that one should at the time of the
operation be facing the south. A love-enticing plant
had to be plucked in this way, and immediately before
sunrise.</p>

<p>There was much superstition in weather lore, as the
beliefs connected with St. Swithin's Day indicate. Certain
days were lucky for removals in certain directions.
Saturday was the day for flitting northward, and Monday
for flitting southward. Monday was "the key of the
week". An old Gaelic saying, repeated in various
forms in folk stories, runs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Shut the north window,</div>
<div class="line i1">  And quickly close the window to the south;</div>
<div class="line">And shut the window facing west,</div>
<div class="line i1">  Evil never came from the east.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
South-running water was "powerful" for working protective
charms; north-running water brought evil.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_212.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>Diagram of the Gaelic Airts (Cardinal Points) and their Associated Colours
referred to in the text</p>

<p>Spring was connected with the east, summer with the south, autumn with the west,
and winter with the north.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The idea behind these and other similar beliefs was
that "the four red divisions" or the "four brown divisions"
of the world were controlled by deities or groups
of deities, whose influences for good or evil were continually
"flowing", and especially when winds were
blowing. A good deity sent a good wind, and a bad
deity sent a bad wind. Each wind was coloured. The
north was the airt<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> (cardinal point) of evil, misfortune,
and bad luck, and was coloured black; the south was
the source of good luck, good fortune, summer, and
longevity, and was coloured white; the east was a
specially sacred airt, and was coloured purple-red, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
the west was the airt of death, and was coloured dun or
pale. East and south and north and west were connected.
There were various colours for the subsidiary
points of the compass.</p>

<p>This doctrine was a very ancient one, because we find
that in the Gaelic language the specially good words
are based on the word for the south, and the specially
bad ones on the name for the north. In Welsh and
Gaelic the north is on the left hand and the south on the
right hand, the east in front, and the west behind. It is
evident, therefore, that the colour scheme of the cardinal
points had a connection with sun worship. A man who
adored the rising sun faced the east, and had the north
on his left and the south on his right. In early Christian
Gaelic literature it is stated that on the Day of Judgment
the goats (sinners) will be sent to the north (the left
hand) and the sheep (the justified) to the south (the right
hand).</p>

<p>The same system can be traced in burial customs.
Many of the ancient graves lie east and west. Graves
that lie north and south may have been those of the
members of a different religious cult, but in some cases
it is found that the dead were placed in position so that
they faced the east. In the most ancient graves in
Egypt men were laid on their right sides with their feet
directed towards the "red north" and their faces towards
the golden east. Women were laid on the left sides
facing the east. Red was in ancient Egypt the male
colour, and white and yellow the female colours; the
feet of the men were towards the red north and those of
women towards the white or yellow south.</p>

<p>All ancient British burials were not made in accordance
with solar-cult customs. It can be shown, however,
in some cases that, although a burial custom may appear
to be either of local or of independent origin, the fundamental
doctrine of which it was an expression was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
same as that behind other burial customs. Reference
may be made, by way of illustration, to the graves at
the stone circle of Hakpen Hill in the Avebury area.
In the seventeenth century a large number of skeletons
were here unearthed. Dr. Toope of Oxford, writing in
1685, has recorded in this connection:<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p class="blockquote">"About 80 yards from where the bones were found is a
temple,<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> 40 yards diameter, with another 15 yards; round
about bones layd so close that scul (skull) toucheth scul.
Their feet all round turned towards the temple, one foot
below the surface of the ground. At the feet of the first
order lay the head of the next row, the feet always tending
towards the temple."</p>

<p>Here the stone circle is apparently the symbol of the
sun and the "Mecca" from which the good influence
or "luck" of the sun emanated and gave protection.
One seems to come into touch with the influence of
an organized priesthood in this stone circle burial
custom.</p>

<p>The more ancient custom of burying the dead so that
the influences of the airts might be exercised upon them
according to their deserts seems, however, to have been
deep-rooted and persistent. In England, Wales, Scotland,
and Ireland the custom obtained until recently of
reserving the north side of a churchyard for suicides
and murderers; the "black north" was the proper place
for such wrong-doers, who were refused Christian rites
of burial, and were interred according to traditional
pagan customs. The east was reserved chiefly for
ecclesiastics, the south for the upper classes, and the
west for the poorer classes. Funeral processions still
enter the older churchyards from the east, and proceed
in the direction of the sun towards the open graves.
Suicides and murderers were carried in the opposite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
direction ("withershins about").<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> The custom of dealing
out cards "sunwise", of stirring food "sunwise", and
other customs in which turning to the right (the south)
is observed, appear to be relics of the ancient belief in
the influences of the airts. Some fishermen still consider
it unlucky to turn their boats "against the sun". It
was anciently believed, as references in old ballads indicate,
that a tempest-stricken vessel turned round three
times against the sun before it sank. According to a
belief that has survival in some parts of the north of
Scotland, the devil will appear in the centre of a stone
circle if one walks round it three times "against the sun"
at midnight. Among the ancient Irish warriors, Professor
W. J. Watson tells me, it was a mark of hostile
intent to drive round a fort keeping the left hand towards
it. The early Christian custom of circulating chapels
and dwelling-houses "sunwise" was based on the
pagan belief that good influences were conjured in this
way.</p>

<p>As the winds were coloured like the airts from which
they blew, it was believed that they could be influenced
by coloured objects. In his description of the Western
Isles, Martin, a seventeenth century writer, referring to
the Fladda Chuan Island, relates:</p>

<p class="blockquote">"There is a chapel in the isle dedicated to St. Columba.
It has an altar in the east end and therein a blue stone of
a round form on it, which is always moist. It is an ordinary
custom, when any of the fishermen are detained in the isle by
contrary winds, to wash the blue stone with water all round,
expecting thereby to procure a favourable wind.... And so
great is the regard they have for this stone, that they swear
decisive oaths upon it."</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>ONE OF THE GREAT TRI-LITHONS, STONEHENGE</p>

<p>(see page <a href="#Page_174">174</a>)</p>
</div></div>

<p>The moist stone had an indwelling spirit, and was therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
a holy object which made vows and agreements of
binding character. In Japan a stone of this kind is
called <i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">shintai</i> ("god body"). The Gaelic name for a
god body is "<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">cuach anama</i>" ("soul shrine", or "spirit-case",
or "spirit-husk"). <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Coich na cno</i> is the shell of a
nut. The Chinese believe that moist and coloured
stones are the "eggs" of weather-controlling dragons.</p>

<p>The connection between blue and the mother goddess
is of great antiquity. Imitation cowries and other shells
in blue enamelled terra-cotta have been found in Egyptian
graves. Blue was the colour of the "luck stone" of
Hathor, the sky and water goddess whose symbols included
the cowrie. The Brigantes of ancient Britain
had, according to Seneca, blue shields. Shields were
connected with the goddess of war. In Gaelic, blue is
the luck colour for womens' clothing.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> English and
Scottish fishermen still use blue as a mourning colour.
When a death takes place, a blue line is painted round
a fishing-boat. The desire for protection by invoking the
blue goddess probably gave origin to this custom.</p>

<p>As influences came from the coloured airts, so did the
great deities and the groups of minor deities associated
with them. The god Lugh, for instance, always comes
in the old stories from the north-east, while the goddess
Morrigan comes from the north-west.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> The fierce wind-raising
Scottish goddess of spring comes from the south-west.
All over Britain the fairies come from the west
and on eddies of wind like the Greek nereids. In Scotland
the evil-working giants come from the black north.
It was believed that the dead went westward or south-westward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
towards Paradise. The fact that the axis of
Stonehenge circle and avenue points to the north-east is
of special interest when we find that the god Lugh, a
Celtic Apollo, came from that airt. Either Lugh, or a
god like him, may have been invoked to come through
the avenue or to send his influence through it, while the
priests walked in procession round the circle sunwise.
Apparently the south-west part of the circle, with its
great trilithons, resembling the portals of the goddess
Artemis, was specially consecrated to a goddess like the
Scottish Cailleach ("Old Wife") who had herds of wild
animals, protected deer from huntsmen, raised storms,
and transformed herself into a standing stone. The
Gaulish goddess Ro-smerta ("very smeared") is regularly
associated with the god identified with Mercury.
The god Smertullis is equated with Essus (the war god)
by d'Arbois de Jubainville.</p>

<p>The differently coloured winds were divine influences
and revealed their characters by their colours. It was
apparently because water was impregnated with the
influences of the deities that wind and water beliefs were
closely associated. Holy and curative wells and sacred
rivers and lakes were numerous in ancient Britain and
Ireland. Offerings made at wells were offerings made
to a deity. These offerings might be gold and silver,
as was the case in Gaul, or simply pins of copper. A
good many wells are still known as "pin wells" and
"penny wells". The metals and pearls and precious
stones supposed to contain vital substance were offered
to the deities so as to animate them. The images of
gods were painted red for the same reason, or sacrifices
were offered and their altars drenched with blood. In
Ireland children were sacrificed to a god called Crom
Cruach and exchanged for milk and corn. As a Gaelic
poem records:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="line">Great was the horror and the scare of him.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
The ancient doctrines of which faint or fragmentary
traces survive in Britain and Ireland may have been
similar to those taught by the Druids in Gaul. According
to Pomponius Mela, these sages professed to know
the secrets of the motions of the heavenly bodies and
the will of the gods.<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Strabo's statement that the Druids
believed that "human souls and the world were immortal,
but that fire and water would sometime prevail"
is somewhat obscure. It may be, however, that light is
thrown on the underlying doctrine by the evidence given
in the next chapter regarding the beliefs that fire, water,
and trees were intimately connected with the chief
deity.</p>

<p>Gildas, a sixth-century churchman, tells us that the
idols in ancient Britain "almost surpassed in number
those of Egypt". That he did not refer merely to
standing stones, which, as we have seen, were "idols"
to the Gaels, is evident from his precise statements that
some idols could be seen in his day "mouldering away
within or without the deserted temples", and that they
had "stiff and deformed features". "Mouldering" suggests
wood. Gildas states further that besides worshipping
idols the British pagans were wont to pay "divine
honour" to hills and wells and rivers. Reference is
made in the <cite>Life of Columba</cite> to a well which was worshipped
as a god.</p>

<p>The British temples are referred to also by Pope
Gregory the Great, who in a.d. 601 addressed a letter
to Abbot Mellitus, then on a mission to England, giving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
him instructions for the guidance of Augustine of
Canterbury. The Pope did not wish to have the
heathen buildings destroyed, "for", he wrote, "if those
are well constructed, it is requisite that they can be converted
from the worship of demons to the service of the
true God.... Let the idols that are in them be destroyed."<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>The temples in question may have been those erected
during the Romano-British period. One which stood
at Canterbury was taken possession of by St. Augustine
after the conversion of King Ethelbert, who had worshipped
idols in it. The Celtic peoples may, however,
have had temples before the Roman invasion. At any
rate there were temples as well as sacred groves in Gaul.
Poseidonius of Apamea refers to a temple at Toulouse
which was greatly revered and richly endowed by the
gifts of numerous donors. These gifts included "large
quantities of gold consecrated to the gods". The Druids
crucified human victims who were sacrificed within their
temples.</p>

<p>Diodorus Siculus refers as follows to a famous temple
in Britain:</p>

<p class="blockquote">"There is in that island a magnificent temple of Apollo
and a circular shrine, adorned with votive offerings and tablets
with Greek inscriptions suspended by travellers upon the
walls. The kings of that city and rulers of the temples are
the Boreads who take up the government from each other
according to the order of their tribes. The citizens are given
up to music, harping and chaunting in honour of the sun."</p>

<p>Some writers have identified this temple with Stonehenge
circle. Layamon informs us in his <i>Brute</i>, however,
that the temple of Apollo was situated in London.
Of course there may have been several temples to this
god or the British deity identified with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
It may be that the stone circles were regarded as
temples. It may be, too, that temples constructed of
wattles and clay were associated with the circles. In
Pope Gregory's letter reference is made to the custom of
constructing on festival days "tabernacles of branches
of trees around those churches which have been changed
from heathen temples", and to the pagan custom of
slaying "oxen in sacrifices to demons". Pytheas refers
to a temple on an island opposite the mouth of the Loire.
This island was inhabited by women only, and once a
year they unroofed and reroofed their temple. In the
Hebrides the annual custom of unroofing and reroofing
thatched houses is not yet obsolete; it may originally
have had a religious significance.</p>

<p>Gildas's reference to the worship of hills, wells, and
rivers is by some writers regarded as evidence of the
existence in ancient Britain of the "primitive belief"
in spirits. This stage of religious culture is called
Animism (Spiritism). The discovery, however, that a
goddess was worshipped in Aurignacian times by the
Crô-Magnon peoples in Western Europe suggests that
Animistic beliefs were not necessarily as ancient as has
been assumed. It may be that what we know as Animism
was a product of a later period when there arose somewhat
complex ideas about the soul or the various souls
in man, and the belief became widespread that souls
could not only transform themselves into animal shapes,
but could enter statues and gravestones. This conception
may have been confused with earlier ideas about
stones, shells, &amp;c., being impregnated with "life substance"
(the animating principle) derived from the
mother goddess. Backward peoples, who adopted complex
religious beliefs that had grown up in centres of
civilization, may not always have had a complete understanding
of their significance. It is difficult to believe
that even savages, who adopted the boats invented in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
Egypt from those peoples that came into touch with them,
were always entirely immune to other cultural influences,
and retained for thousands of years the beliefs supposed
to be appropriate for those who were in the "Stone Age".</p>

<p>Our concern here is with the ancient Britons. It is
unnecessary for us to glean evidence from Australia,
South America, or Central Africa to ascertain the character
of their early religious conceptions and practices.
There is sufficient local evidence to show that a definite
body of beliefs lay behind their worship of trees, rivers,
lakes, wells, standing stones, and of the sun, moon, and
stars. Our ancestors do not appear to have worshipped
natural objects either because they were beautiful or
impressive, but chiefly because they were supposed to
contain influences which affected mankind either directly
or indirectly. These influences were supposed to be
under divine control, and to emanate, in the first place,
from one deity or another, or from groups of deities. A
god or goddess was worshipped whether his or her
influence was good or bad. The deity who sent disease,
for instance, was believed to be the controller of disease,
and to him or her offerings were made so that a plague
might cease. Thus in the <i>Iliad</i> offerings are made to
the god Mouse-Apollo, who had caused an epidemic of
disease.</p>

<p>Trees and wells were connected with the sky and the
heavenly bodies. The deity who caused thunder and
lightning had his habitation at times in the oak, the fir,
the rowan, the hazel, or some other tree. He was the
controller of the elements. There are references in
Gaelic charms to "the King of the Elements".</p>

<p>The belief in an intimate connection between a well,
a tree, and the sky appears to have been a product of
a quaint but not unintelligent process of reasoning.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
The early folk were thinkers, but their reasoning was
confined within the limits of their knowledge, and
biassed by preconceived ideas. To them water was the
source of all life. It fell from the sky as rain, or bubbled
up from the underworld to form a well from which a
stream flowed. The well was the mother of the stream,
and the stream was the mother of the lake. It was
believed that the well-water was specially impregnated
with the influences that sustained life. The tree that
grew beside the well was nourished by it. If this tree
was a rowan, its red berries were supposed to contain in
concentrated form the animating influence of the deity;
the berries cured diseases, and thus renewed youth, or
protected those who used them as charms against evil
influences. They were luck-berries. If the tree was a
hazel, its nuts were similarly efficacious; if an oak, its
acorns were regarded likewise as luck-bringers. The
parasitic plant that grew on the tree was supposed to be
stronger and more influential than the tree itself. This
belief, which is so contrary to our way of thinking, is
accounted for in an old Gaelic story in which a supernatural
being says:</p>

<p class="blockquote">"O man that for Fergus of the feasts dost kindle fire ...
never burn the King of the Woods. Monarch of Innisfail's
forest the woodbine is, whom none may hold captive; no
feeble sovereign's effort it is to hug all tough trees in his
embrace."</p>

<p>The weakly parasite was thus regarded as being very
powerful. That may be the reason why the mistletoe
was reverenced, and why its milk-white berries were
supposed to have curative and life-prolonging qualities.</p>

<p>Although the sacred parasite was not used for firewood,
it served as a fire-producer. Two fire-sticks, one
from the soft parasite and one from the hard wood of the
tree to which it clung, were rubbed together until sparks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
issued forth and fell on dry leaves or dry grass. The
sparks were blown until a flame sprang up. At this
flame of holy fire the people kindled their brands, which
they carried to their houses. The house fires were extinguished
once a year and relit from the sacred flames.
Fire was itself a deity, and the deity was "fed" with
fuel. "Need fires" (new fires)<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> were kindled at festivals
so that cattle and human beings might be charmed
against injury. These festivals were held four times a
year, and the "new-fire" custom lingers in those districts
where New Year's Day, Midsummer, May Day,
and Hallowe'en bon-fires are still being regularly kindled.</p>

<p>The fact that fire came from a tree induced the early
people to believe that it was connected with lightning,
and therefore with the sky god who thundered in the
heavens. This god was supposed to wield a thunder-axe
or thunder-hammer with which he smote the sky
(believed to be solid) or the hills. With his axe or
hammer he shaped the "world house".</p>

<p>In Scotland, a goddess, who is remembered as "the
old wife",<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> was supposed to wield the hammer, or to ride
across the sky on a cloud and throw down "fire-balls"
that set the woods in flame. Here we find, probably as
a result of culture mixing, a fusion of beliefs connected
with the thunder god and the mother goddess.</p>

<p>Rain fell when the sky deity sent thunder and lightning.
To early man, who took fire from a tree which
was nourished by a well, fire and water seemed to be
intimately connected.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> The red berries on the sacred
tree were supposed to contain fire, or the essence of fire.
When he made rowan-berry wine, he regarded it as
"fire water" or "the water of life". He drank it, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
thus introduced into his blood fire which stimulated him.
In his blood was "the vital spark". When he died the
blood grew cold, because the "vital spark" had departed
from it.</p>

<p>In the water fire lived in another form. Fish were
found to be phosphorescent. The fish in the pool was
at any rate regarded as a form of the deity who nourished
life and was the origin of life. A specially sacred fish
was the salmon. It was observed that this fish had red
spots, and these were accounted for by the myth that the
red berries or nuts from the holy tree dropped into the
well and were swallowed by the salmon. The "chief"
or "king" of the salmon was called "the salmon of
wisdom". If one caught the "salmon of wisdom" and,
when roasting it, tasted the first portion of juice that
came from its body, one obtained a special instalment of
concentrated wisdom, and became a seer, or magician, or
Druid.</p>

<p>The salmon was reverenced also because it was a
migratory fish. Its comings and goings were regular
as the seasons, and seemed to be controlled by the ruler
of the elements with whom it was intimately connected.
One of its old Gaelic names was <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">orc</i> (pig). It was evidently
connected with that animal; the sea-pig was
possibly a form of the deity. The porpoise was also an
<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">orc</i>.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>Hidden in the well lay a great monster which in
Gaelic and Welsh stories is referred to as "the beast",
"the serpent", or "the great worm". Ultimately it
was identified with the dragon with fiery breath. An
Irish story connects the salmon and dragon. It tells
that a harper named Cliach, who had the powers of a
Druid, kept playing his harp until a lake sprang up.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
This lake was visited by a goddess and her attendants,
who had assumed the forms of beautiful birds. It was
called Loch Bél Seád ("lake of the jewel mouth") because
pearls were found in it, and Loch Crotto Cliach
("lake of Cliach's harps"). Another name was Loch
Bél Dragain ("dragon-mouth lake"), because Ternog's
nurse caught "a fiery dragon in the shape of a salmon"
and she was induced to throw this salmon into the
loch. The early Christian addition to the legend runs:
"And it is that dragon that will come in the festival of
St. John, near the end of the world, in the reign of Flann
Cinaidh. And it is of it and out of it shall grow the
fiery bolt which will kill three-fourth of the people of the
world."<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> Here fire is connected with the salmon.</p>

<p>The salmon which could transform itself into a great
monster guarded the tree and its life-giving berries and
the treasure offered to the deity of the well. Apparently
its own strength was supposed to be derived from or
concentrated in the berries. The queen of the district
obtained the supernatural power she was supposed to
possess from the berries too, and stories are told of
a hero who was persuaded to enter the pool and pluck
the berries for the queen. He was invariably attacked
by the "beast", and, after handing the berries to the
queen, he fell down and died. There are several versions
of this story. In one version a specially valued
gold ring, a symbol of authority, is thrown into the
pool and swallowed by the salmon. The hero catches
and throws the salmon on to the bank. When he
plucks the berries, he is attacked by the monster and
kills it. Having recovered the ring, he gives it to the
princess, who becomes his wife. Apparently she will be
chosen as the next queen, because she has eaten the
salmon and obtained the gold symbol.</p>

<p>It may be that this story had its origin in the practice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
of offering a human sacrifice to the deity of the pool, so
that the youth-renewing red berries might be obtained
for the queen, the human representative of the deity.
Her fate was connected with the ring of gold in which,
as in the berries, the influence of the deity was concentrated.</p>

<p>Polycrates of Samos, a Hellenic sea-king, was similarly
supposed to have his "luck" connected with a
beautiful seal-stone, the most precious of his jewels.
On the advice of Pharaoh Amasis of Egypt he flung
it into the sea. According to Herodotus, it was to avert
his doom that he disposed of the ring. But he could
not escape his fate. The jewel came back; it was found
a few days later in the stomach of a big fish.</p>

<p>In India, China, and Japan dragons or sea monsters
are supposed to have luck pearls which confer great power
on those who obtain possession of them. The famous
"jewel that grants all desires" and the jewels that
control the ebb and flow of tides are obtained from,
and are ultimately returned to, sea-monsters of the
dragon order.</p>

<p>The British and Irish myths about sacred gold or
jewels obtained from the dragon or one of its forms were
taken over with much else by the early Christian missionaries,
and given a Christian significance. Among
the legends attached to the memory of the Irish Saint
Moling is one that tells how he obtained treasure for
Christian purposes. His fishermen caught a salmon
and found in its stomach an ingot of gold. Moling
divided the gold into three parts&mdash;"one third for the
poor, another for the ornamenting of shrines, a third to
provide for labour and work".</p>

<p>The most complete form of the ancient myth is, however,
found in the life of Glasgow's patron saint, St.
Kentigern (St. Mungo). A queen's gold ring had been
thrown into the River Clyde, and, as she was unable,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
when asked by the king, to produce it, she was condemned
to death and cast into a dungeon. The queen
appealed to St. Kentigern, who instructed her messenger
to catch a fish in the river and bring it to him. A
large fish "commonly called a salmon" was caught.
In its stomach was found the missing ring. The grateful
queen, on her release, confessed her sins to the saint
and became a Christian. St. Mungo's seal, now the
coat of arms of Glasgow, shows the salmon with a ring
in its mouth, below an oak tree, in the branches of
which sits, as the oracle bird, a robin red-breast. A
Christian bell dangles from a branch of the tree.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_230.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>Seal of City of Glasgow, 1647-1793, showing Tree, Bird, Salmon,
and Bell</p>
</div></div>

<p>That the Glasgow saint took the place of a Druid,<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> so
that the people might say "Kentigern is my Druid" as
St. Columba said "Christ is my Druid", is suggested
by his intimate connection, as shown in his seal, with
the sacred tree of the "King of the Elements", the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
oracular bird (the thunder bird), the salmon form of the
deity, and the power-conferring ring. As the Druids
produced sacred fire from wood, so did St. Kentigern.
It is told that when a youth his rivals extinguished the
sacred fire under his care. Kentigern went outside the
monastery and obtained "a bough of growing hazel and
prayed to the 'Father of Lights'". Then he made
the sign of the cross, blessed the bough, and breathed
on it.</p>

<p class="blockquote">"A wonderful and remarkable thing followed. Straightway
fire coming forth from heaven, seizing the bough, as if the
boy had exhaled flames for breath, sent forth fire, vomiting
rays, and banished all the surrounding darkness.... God
therefore sent forth His light, and led him and brought him
into the monastery.... That hazel from which the little
branch was taken received a blessing from St. Kentigern,
and afterwards began to grow into a wood. If from that
grove of hazel, as the country folks say, even the greenest
branch is taken, even at the present day, it catches fire like
the driest material at the touch of fire...."</p>

<p>A red-breast, which was kept as a pet at the monastery,
was hunted by boys, who tore off its head. Kentigern
restored the bird to life. The robin was hunted down
in some districts as was the wren in other districts. An
old rhyme runs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">A robin and a wren</div>
<div class="line">Are God's cock and hen.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In Pagan times the oracular bird connected with the
holy tree was sacrificed annually. The robin represented
the god and the wren (Kitty or Jenny Wren) the
goddess in some areas. In Gaelic, Spanish, Italian,
and Greek the wren is "the little King" or "the King
of Birds". A Gaelic folk-tale tells that the wren flew
highest in a competition held by the birds for the kingship,
by concealing itself on an eagle's back. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
the eagle reached its highest possible altitude, the wren
rose above it and claimed the honour of kingship. In
the Isle of Man the wren used to be hunted on St.
Stephen's Day. Elsewhere it was hunted on Christmas
Eve or Christmas Day. The dead bird was carried on
a pole at the head of a procession and buried with ceremony
in a churchyard.</p>

<p>In Scotland the shrew mouse was hunted in like manner,
and buried under an apple tree. A standing stone
in Perthshire is called in Gaelic "stone of my little
mouse". As there were mouse feasts in ancient Scotland,
it would appear that a mouse god like Smintheus
(Mouse-Apollo) was worshipped in ancient times. Mouse
cures were at one time prevalent. The liver of the
mouse<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> was given to children who were believed to be
on the point of death. They rallied quickly after swallowing
it. Roasted mouse was in England and Scotland
a cure for whooping-cough and smallpox. The Boers
in South Africa are perpetuating this ancient folk-cure.<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
In Gaelic folk-lore the mouse deity is remembered as
<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">lucha sith</i> ("the supernatural mouse").</p>

<p>There still survive traces of the worship of a goddess
who is remembered as Bride in England and Scotland,
and as Brigit in Ireland. A good deal of the lore
connected with her has been attached to the memory
of St. Brigit of Ireland.</p>

<p>February 1st (old style) was known as Bride's Day.
Her birds were the wood linnet, which in Gaelic is called
"Bird of Bride", and the oyster catcher called "Page
of Bride", while her plant was the dandelion (<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">am bearnan
brìde</i>), the "milk" of which was the salvation of the
early lamb. On Bride's Day the serpent awoke from its
winter sleep and crept from its hole. This serpent is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
called in Gaelic "daughter of Ivor", <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">an ribhinn</i> ("the
damsel"), &amp;c.</p>

<p>The white serpent was, like the salmon, a source of
wisdom and magical power. It was evidently a form of
the goddess. Brigit was the goddess of the Brigantes,
a tribe whose territory extended from the Firth of Forth
to the midlands of England.<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> The Brigantes took
possession of a part of Ireland where Brigit had three
forms as the goddess of healing, the goddess of smith-work,
and the goddess of poetry, and therefore of
metrical magical charms. Some think her name signifies
"fiery arrow". She was the source of fire, and was
connected with different trees in different areas. The
Bride-wells were taken over by Saint Bride.</p>

<p>The white serpent, referred to in the legends associated
with Farquhar, the physician, and Michael Scott, sometimes
travelled very swiftly by forming itself into a ring
with its tail in its mouth. This looks like the old Celtic
solar serpent. If the serpent were cut in two, the parts
wriggled towards a stream and united as soon as they
touched water. If the head were not smashed, it would
become a <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">beithis</i>, the biggest and most poisonous variety
of serpent.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> The "Deathless snake" of Egypt, referred
to in an ancient folk-tale, was similarly able to unite its
severed body. Bride's serpent links with the serpent
dragons of the Far East, which sleep all winter and
emerge in spring, when they cause thunder and send
rain, spit pearls, &amp;c. Dr. Alexander Carmichael translates
the following Gaelic serpent-charm:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">To-day is the day of Bride,</div>
<div class="line">The serpent shall come from his hole;</div>
<div class="line"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
I will not molest the serpent</div>
<div class="line">And the serpent will not molest me.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>De Visser<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> quotes the following from a Chinese text

<p>The serpent, known in Scotland as <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">nathair challtuinn</i>
("snake of the hazel grove"), had evidently a mythological
significance. Leviathan is represented by the
Gaelic <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">cirein cròin</i> (sea-serpent), also called <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">mial mhòr
a chuain</i> ("the great beast of the sea") and <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">cuairtag
mhòr a chuain</i> ("the great whirlpool of the sea"); a
sea-snake was supposed to be located in Corryvreckan
whirlpool. Kelpies and water horses and water bulls
are forms assumed by the Scottish dragon. There are
Far Eastern horse-and bull-dragons.</p>

<p>In ancient British lore there are references to souls in
serpent form. A serpent might be a "double" like the
Egyptian "Ka". It was believed in Wales that snake-souls
were concealed in every farm-house. When one
crept out from its hiding-place and died, the farmer or
his wife died soon afterwards. Lizards were supposed
to be forms assumed by women after death.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> The otter,
called in Scottish Gaelic <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Dobhar-chù</i> ("water dog") and
<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Righ nàn Dobhran</i> ("king of the water" or "river"),
appears to have been a soul form. When one was
killed a man or a woman died. The king otter was
supposed to have a jewel in its head like the Indian
<i lang="hi" xml:lang="hi">n&#257;ga</i> (serpent deity), the Chinese dragon, the toad, &amp;c.
The king otter was invulnerable except on one white
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
spot below its chin. Those who wore a piece of its
skin as a charm were supposed to be protected against
injury in battle. Evidently, therefore, the otter was
originally a god like the boar, the image of which, as
Tacitus records, was worn for protection by the Baltic
amber searchers of Celtic speech. The <i>biasd na srogaig</i>
("the beast of the lowering horn") was a Hebridean
loch dragon with a single horn on its head; this unicorn
was tall and clumsy.</p>

<p>The "double" or external soul might also exist in
a tree. Both in England and Scotland there are stories
of trees withering when some one dies, or of some one
dying when trees are felled. Aubrey tells that when
the Earl of Winchelsea began to cut down an oak grove
near his seat at Eastwell in Kent, the Countess died
suddenly, and then his eldest son, Lord Maidstone, was
killed at sea. Allan Ramsay, the Scottish poet, tells
that the Edgewell tree near Dalhousie Castle was fatal
to the family from which he was descended, and Sir
Walter Scott refers to it in his "Journal", under the
date 13th May, 1829. When a branch fell from it in
July, 1874, an old forester exclaimed "The laird's deed
noo!" and word was received not long afterwards of the
death of the eleventh Earl of Dalhousie. Souls of giants
were supposed to be hidden in thorns, eggs, fish, swans,
&amp;c. At Fasnacloich, in Argyllshire, the visit of swans
to a small loch is supposed to herald the death of a
Stewart.</p>

<p>"External souls", or souls after death, assumed the
forms of cormorants, cuckoos, cranes, eagles, gulls,
herons, linnets, magpies, ravens, swans, wrens, &amp;c.,
or of deer, mice, cats, dogs, &amp;c. Fairies (supernatural
beings) appeared as deer or birds. Among the Scottish
were-animals are cats, black sheep, mice, hares, gulls,
crows, ravens, magpies, foxes, dogs, &amp;c. Children
were sometimes transformed by magicians into white
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
dogs, and were restored to human form by striking
them with a magic wand or by supplying shirts of bog-cotton.
The floating lore regarding were-animals was
absorbed in witch-lore after the Continental beliefs regarding
witches were imported into this country. In
like manner a good deal of floating lore was attached
to the devil. In Scotland he is supposed to appear as
a goat or pig, as a gentleman with a pig's or horse's
foot, or as a black or green man riding a black or green
horse followed by black or green dogs. Eels were
"devil-fish", and were supposed to originate from the
hairs of horses' manes or tails. Men who ate eels became
insane, and fought horses.</p>

<p>In Scotland butterflies and bees were not only soul-forms
but deities, and there are traces of similar beliefs
in England, Wales, and Ireland. Scottish Gaelic names
of the butterfly include <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">dealbhan-dé</i> ("image" or "form
of God"), <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">dealbh</i> signifying "image", "form", "picture",
"idol", or "statue"; <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">dearbadan-dé</i> ("manifestation of
God"); <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">eunan-dé</i> ("small bird of God"); <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">teine-dé</i> ("fire
of God"); and <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">dealan-dé</i> ("brightness of God"). The
word <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">dealan</i> refers to (1) lightning, (2) the brightness of
the starry sky, (3) burning coal, (4) the wooden bar of a
door, and (5) to a wooden peg fastening a cow-halter
round the neck. The bar and peg, which gave security,
were evidently connected with the deity.</p>

<p>In addition to meaning butterfly, <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">dealan-dé</i> ("the
<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">dealan</i> of God") refers to a burning stick which is
shaken to and fro or whirled round about. When
"need fires" (new fires) were lit at Beltain festival
(1st May)&mdash;"Beltain" is supposed to mean "bright
fires" or "white fires", that is, luck-bringing or sacred
fires&mdash;burning brands were carried from them to houses,
all domestic fires having previously been extinguished.
The "new fire" brought luck, prosperity, health, increase,
protection, &amp;c. Until recently Highland boys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
who perpetuated the custom of lighting bon-fires to
celebrate old Celtic festivals were wont to snatch burning
sticks from them and run homewards, whirling the
<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">dealan-dé</i> round about so as to keep it burning.</p>

<p>Souls took the form of a <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">dealan-dé</i> (butterfly). Lady
Wilde relates in <cite>Ancient Legends</cite> (Vol. I, pp. 66-7)
the Irish story of a child who saw the butterfly form
of the soul&mdash;"a beautiful living creature with four
snow-white wings"; it rose from the body of a man
who had just died and went "fluttering round his
head". The child and others watched the winged
soul "until it passed from sight into the clouds". The
story continues: "This was the first butterfly that was
ever seen in Ireland; and now all men know that the
butterflies are the souls of the dead waiting for the
moment when they may enter Purgatory, and so pass
through torture to purification and peace".</p>

<p>In England and Scotland moths were likewise souls
of the dead that entered houses by night or fluttered
outside windows, as if attempting to return to former
haunts.</p>

<p>The butterfly god or soul-form was known to the
Scandinavians. Freyja, the northern goddess, appears
to have had a butterfly <i>avatar</i>. At any rate, the butterfly
was consecrated to her. In Greece the nymph
Psyche, beloved by Cupid, was a beautiful maiden with
the wings of a butterfly; her name signifies "the soul".
Greek artistes frequently depicted the human soul as
a butterfly, and especially the particular species called
&#968;&#965;&#967;&#951; ("the soul"). On an ancient tomb in Italy a
butterfly is shown issuing from the open mouth of
a death-mask. The Serbians believed that the butterfly
souls of witches arose from their mouths when they
slept. They died if their butterfly souls did not return.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
Evidence of belief in the butterfly soul has been forthcoming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
in Burmah, where ceremonies are performed to
prevent the baby's butterfly soul following that of a
dead mother.<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> The pre-Columbian Americans, and
especially the Mexicans, believed in butterfly souls
and butterfly deities. In China the butterfly soul was
carved in jade and associated with the plum tree;<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> the
sacred butterfly was in Scotland associated apparently
with the honeysuckle (<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">deoghalag</i>), a plant containing
"life-substance" in the form of honey (<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">lus a mheahl</i>:
"honey herb") and milk (another name of the plant
being <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">bainne-ghamhnach</i>: "milk of the heifer"). As
we have seen, the honeysuckle was supposed to be
more powerful than the tree to which it clung; like the
ivy and mistletoe, it was the plant of a powerful deity.
Its milk and honey names connect it with the Great
Mother goddess who was the source of life and nourishment,
and provided the milk-and-honey elixir of life.</p>

<p>Bee-souls figure in Scottish folk-stories. Hugh Miller
relates a story of a sleeping man from whose mouth the
soul issued in the form of the bee.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> Another of like
character is related by a clergyman.<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> Both are located
in the north of Scotland, where, as in the south of England,
the custom was prevalent of "telling the bees"
when a death took place, and of placing crape on hives.
The bee-mandible symbol appears on Scottish sculptured
stones. Both the bee and the butterfly were
connected with the goddess Artemis. Milk-yielding
fig trees were fertilized by bees or wasps, and the goddess,
especially in her form as Diana of the Ephesians,
was connected with the fig tree, the figs being "teats".</p>

<p>Little is known regarding the Hebridean sea-god
<i>Seonaidh</i> (pronounced "shony"), who may have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
a form of the sea-god known to the Irish as Lir and
to the Welsh as Llyr. His name connects him with
the word <i>seonadh</i>, signifying "augury", "sorcery",
"druidism". According to Martin, the inhabitants of
Lewis contributed the malt from which ale was brewed
for an offering to the gods. At night a man waded
into the sea up to his middle and cried out, "Seonaidh!
I give thee this cup of ale, hoping that thou wilt be
so good as to send us plenty of sea-ware for enriching
our ground during the coming year." He then poured
the ale into the sea. The people afterwards gathered
in the church of St. Mulway, and stood still for a time
before the altar on which a candle was burning. When
a certain signal was given the candle was extinguished.
The people then made merry in the fields, drinking ale.</p>

<small>Ancient Pagan Deities</small></h2>

Cauldron&mdash;Goddess&mdash;Romano-British Deities&mdash;Grouped Goddesses&mdash;The
Star Goddess&mdash;Sky and Sea Spirits.</p>

<p>Many of the old British and Irish deities had bird
forms, and might appear as doves, swallows, swans,
cranes, cormorants, scald crows, ravens, &amp;c. The cormorant,
for instance, is still in some districts called the
<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Cailleach dubh</i> ("the black old wife"). Some deities, like
Brigit and Morrigan, had triple forms, and appeared as
three old hags or as three beautiful girls, or assumed
the forms of women known to those they visited. In
the Cuchullin stories the Morrigan appears with a
supernatural cow, the milk of which heals wounds and
prolongs life. When in conflict with Cuchullin, she
takes alternately the forms of an eel, a grey wolf, and a
white cow with red ears. On one occasion she changes
from human form to that of a dark bird. An old west
of England goddess was remembered until recently in
Leicestershire as "Black Annis", "Black Anny", or
"Cat Anna". She frequented a cave on the Dane
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
Hills,<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> above which grew an oak tree. In the branches of
the tree she concealed herself, so that she might pounce
unawares on human beings. Shepherds attributed to
her the loss of lambs, and mothers their loss of children.
The supernatural monster had one eye in her blue face,
and talons instead of hands. Round her waist she wore
a girdle of human skins.</p>

<p>A Scottish deity called "Yellow Muilearteach" was
similarly one-eyed and blue-faced, and had tusks protruding
from her mouth. An apple dangled from her
waist girdle. The Indian goddess Black Kali is depicted
as a ferocious being of like character, with a forehead
eye, in addition to ordinary eyes, and a waist girdle of
human heads. Greece had its Black Demeter with
animal-head (a horse's or pig's), and snakes in her
hair. She haunted a cave in Phigalia. The Egyptian
goddess Hathor in her cat form (Bast) was kindly,
and in her Sekhet form was a fierce slayer of mankind.<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>Witches assume cat forms in Scottish witch lore,<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> and
appear on the riggings and masts of ships doomed to
destruction. There are references, too, to cat roasting,
so as to compel the "Big Cat" to appear. The "Big
Cat" is evidently the deity. In northern India dogs are
tortured to compel the "Big Dog" (the god Indra) to
send rain. "Lapus Cati" (the cat stone) is referred to
in early Christian records. As a mouse was buried
under an apple tree to make it fruitful, a cat was buried
under a pear tree.</p>

<p>The Scottish "Yellow Muilearteach" revels in the
slaughter of human beings, and folk poems, describing
a battle waged against her, have been collected. In the
end she is slain, and her consort comes from the sea to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
lament her death. A similar hag is remembered as the
Cailleach ("the old wife"). She had a "blue-black
face" and one eye "on the flat of her forehead", and
she carried a magic hammer. During the period of
"the little sun" (the winter season) she held sway over
the world. Her blanket was washed in the whirlpool of
Corryvreckan, which kept boiling vigorously for several
days. Ben Nevis was her chief dwelling-place, and in
a cave in that mountain she kept as a prisoner all winter
a beautiful maiden who was given the task of washing
a brown fleece until it became white. When wandering
among the mountains or along the sea-shore she is
followed, like Artemis, by herds of deer, goats, swine,
&amp;c. The venomous black boar is in some of the stories
under her special protection. Apparently this animal
was her symbol as it was that of the Baltic amber traders.
The hero who hunts and slays the boar is himself killed
by it, as was the Syrian god Adonis by the boar form of
Ares (Mars). In Gaul the boar-god Moccus was identified
by the Romans with Mars.</p>

<p>In Gaelic stories the hero who hunts and slays the
boar is remembered as Diarmid, the eponymous ancestor
of the Campbell clan. Apparently the goddess was the
ugly hag to whom he once gave shelter. She transformed
herself into a beautiful maiden who touched his
forehead and left on it a "love spot".<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>When she vanished he followed her to the "Land-Under-Waves".
There he finds her as a beautiful girl
who is suffering from a wasting disease. To cure her
he goes on a long journey to obtain a draught of water
from a healing well. This water he carries in the "Cup
of Healing".</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
The winter hag has a son who falls in love with the
beautiful maiden of Ben Nevis. When he elopes with
her, his mother raises storms in the early spring season
to keep the couple apart and prevent the grass growing.
These storms are named in the Gaelic Calendar as "the
Pecker", "the Whistle", "the Sweeper", "the Complaint",
&amp;c. In the end her son pursues her on horseback,
until she transforms herself into a moist grey stone
"looking over the sea". The story tells that the son's
horse leapt over arms of the sea. On Loch Etiveside
a place-name "Horseshoes" is attached to marks on a
rock supposed to have been caused by his great steed.
In the Isle of Man the place of the giant son is taken
by St. Patrick. He rides from Ireland on horseback
like the ancient sea god. He cursed a monster, which
was turned into solid rock. St. Patrick's steed left the
marks of its hoofs on the cliffs.<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>In Arthurian romance King Arthur pursues Morgan
le Fay, who likewise transforms herself into a stone. A
Welsh folk story tells that Arthur's steed leapt across
the Bristol Channel, and left the marks of its hoofs on a
rock.</p>

<p>It appears that Morgan le Fay is the same deity as
the Irish Morrigan. Both appear to link with Anu, or
Danu, the Irish mother goddess, and with Black Anna
or Annis of Leicestershire. The Irish Danann deities
wage war against the Fomorians, who are referred to in
one instance as the gods of the Fir Domnann (Dumnonii),
the mineral workers or "diggers" of Cornwall and
Devon, of the south-western and central lowlands of
Scotland, and central and south-western Ireland. In
Scotland the Fomorians are numerous; they are hill
and cave giants like the giants of Cornwall. But there
are no Scottish Dananns and no "war of the gods".
The Fomorians of Scotland wage war against the fairies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
(as in Wester Ross) or engage in duels, throwing great
boulders at one another.</p>

<p>The intruding people who in Ireland formulated the
Danann mythology do not appear to have reached Scotland
before the Christian period.</p>

<p>An outstanding difference between Scottish and Irish
beliefs and practices is brought out by the treatment of
the pig in both countries. Like the Continental Celts,
the Irish Celts, who formed a military aristocracy over
the Firbolgs, the Fir Domnann, and the Fir Gailian
(Gauls), kept pigs and ate pork. In Scotland the pig
was a demon as in ancient Egypt, and pork was tabooed
over wide areas. The prejudice against pork in Scotland
is not yet extinct. It is referred to by Sir Walter Scott
in a footnote in <cite>The Fortunes of Nigel</cite>, which states:</p>

<p class="blockquote">"The Scots (Lowlanders), till within the last generation,
disliked swine's flesh as an article of food as much as the
Highlanders do at present. Ben Jonson, in drawing James's
character,<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> says he loved no part of a swine."<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Johnson wrote in his <cite>A Journey to the Western
Highlands in 1773</cite>:</p>

<p class="blockquote">"Of their eels I can give no account, having never tasted
them, for I believe they are not considered as wholesome
food.... The vulgar inhabitants of Skye, I know not
whether of the other islands, have not only eels, but pork
and bacon in abhorrence; and, accordingly, I never saw a
hog in the Hebrides, except one at Dunvegan."</p>

<p>"In the year 1691 a question was put, 'Why do
Scotchmen hate swine's flesh?' and", says J. G. Dalyell,<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>
"unsatisfactorily answered, 'They might borrow
it of the Jews'." As the early Christians of England and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
Ireland did not abhor pork, the prejudice could not
have been of Christian origin. It was based on superstition,
and as the superstitions of to-day were the
religious beliefs of yesterday, the prejudice appears to
be a survival from pagan times. An ancient religious
cult, which may have originally been small, became
influential in Scotland, and the taboo spread even after
its original significance was forgotten. The Scottish
prejudice against pork existed chiefly among "the
common people", as Dr. Johnson found when in Skye.
Proprietors of alien origin and monks ate pork, but the
old taboo persisted. Pig-dealers, &amp;c., in the Highlands
in the nineteenth century refused to eat pork. They
exported their pigs.<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>Traces of ancient food taboos, which were connected
evidently with religious beliefs, have been obtained
by archæologists in England. In some districts pork
appears to have been more favoured than the beef or
mutton or goat flesh preferred in other districts. Evidence
has been forthcoming that horse flesh was eaten
in ancient England. A reference in the <cite>Life of St.
Columba</cite> to a relapsing Christian returning to horse
flesh suggests that it was a favoured food of a Pagan
cult.</p>

<p>As the devil is called in Scottish Gaelic the "Big
Black Pig" and in Wales is associated with the "Black
Sow of All Hallows", it may be that the Welsh had
once their pig taboo too. The association of the pig
with Hallowe'en is of special interest.</p>

<p>In Scotland the eel is still tabooed, although it is
eaten freely in England. The reason may be that an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
ancient goddess, remembered longest in Scotland, had
an eel form. Julius Cæsar tells that the ancient Britons
with whom he came into contact did not regard it lawful
to eat the hare, the domestic fowl, or the goose. In
Scotland and England the goose was, until recently,
eaten only once a year at a festival. The tabooed pig
was eaten once a year in Egypt. It was sacrificed to
Osiris and the moon. An annual sacrificial pig feast
may have been observed in ancient Scotland. It is of
special interest to find in this connection that in the
<cite>Statistical Account of Scotland</cite> (1793) the writer on the
parishes of Sandwick and Stromness, Orkney, says:
"Every family that has a herd of swine, kills a sow on
the 17th day of December, and thence it is called 'Sow-day'."
Orkney retains the name of the Orcs (Boars), a
Pictish tribe.</p>

<p>There are still people in the Highlands who detest
"feathered flesh" or "white flesh" (birds), and refuse
to eat hare and rabbit. Fish taboos have likewise persisted
in the north of Scotland, where mackerel, ling,<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
and skate are disliked in some areas, while in some
even the wholesome haddock is not eaten in the winter
or spring, and is supposed not to be fit for food until
it gets three drinks of May water&mdash;that is, after the
first three May tides have ebbed and flowed.</p>

<p>The Danann deities of Ireland were the children of
descendants of the goddess Danu, whose name is also
given as Ana or Anu. She was the source of abundance
and the nourisher of gods and men. As "Buanann"
she was "nurse of heroes". As Aynia, a
"fairy"<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> queen, she is still remembered in Ulster,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
while as Aine, a Munster "fairy", she was formerly
honoured on St. John's Eve, when villagers, circulating
a mound, carried straw torches which were afterwards
waved over cattle and crops to give protection
and increase.</p>

<p>A prominent Danann god was Dagda, whose name
is translated as "the good god", "the good hand", by
some, and as "the fire god" or "fire of god" by others.
He appears to have been associated with the oak. By
playing his harp, he caused the seasons to follow one
another in their proper order. One of his special
possessions was a cauldron called "The Undry", from
which an inexhaustible food supply could be obtained.
He fed heavily on porridge, and was a cook (supplier of
food) as well as a king. In some respects he resembles
Thor, and, like him, he was a giant slayer. His wife
was the goddess Boann, whose name clings to the
River Boyne, which was supposed to have had its
origin from an overflowing well. Above this well were
nine hazel trees; the red nuts of these fell into the well to
be devoured by salmon and especially by the "salmon
of knowledge". Here again we meet with the tree
and well myth. Brigit was a member of the Dagda's
family. Another was Angus, the god of love.</p>

<p>Diancecht was the Danann god of healing. His
grandson Lugh (pronounced <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">loo</i>) has been called the
"Gaelic Apollo". Goibniu was a Gaelic Vulcan.</p>

<p>Neit, whose wife was Nemon,<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> was a Fomorian god
of battle. The sea god was Manannán mac Lir. He
was known to the Welsh as Manawydan ab Llyr, who
was not only a sea god but "lord of headlands" and
a patron of traders. Llyr has come down as the
legendary King Lear, and his name survives in
Leicester, originally Llyr-cestre of Cær-Llyr (walled
city of Llyr). His famous and gigantic son Bran
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
became, in the process of time, the "Blessed Bran"
who introduced Christianity into Britain.</p>

<p>Another group of Welsh gods, known as "the
children of Don", resemble somewhat the Danann
deities of Ireland. The closest link is Govannon, the
smith, who appears to be identical with the Irish
Goibniu. As Irish pirates invaded and settled in
Wales between the second and fifth centuries of our
era, it may be that the process of "culture mixing"
which resulted can be traced in the mythological
elements embedded in folk and manuscript stories.
The Welsh deities, however, were connected with certain
constellations and may have been "intruders"
from the Continent. Cassiopea's chair was Llys Don
(the court of the goddess Don). Arianrod (silver circle),
a goddess and wife of Govannon, had for her castle
the Northern Crown (Corona Borealis). She is, in
Arthurian romance, the sister of Arthur. Her brother
Gwydion had for his castle the "Milky Way", which
in Irish Gaelic is "the chain of Lugh". The Irish
Danann god Nuada has been identified with the British
Nudd whose children formed the group of "the children
of Nudd".</p>

<p>There were three groups of Welsh deities, the others
being "the children of Lyr" and "the children of Don".
Professor Rhys has identified Nudd with Lud, the god
whose name survives in London (originally Cær Lud)
and in Ludgate, which may, as has been suggested,
have originally been "the way of Lud", leading to his
holy place now occupied by St. Paul's Cathedral. Lud
had a sanctuary at Lidney in Gloucestershire, where he
was worshipped in Roman times as is indicated by inscriptions.
A bronze plaque shows a youthful god,
with solar rays round his head, standing in a four-horsed
chariot. Two winged genii and two Tritons accompany
him. Apparently he was identified with Apollo. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
Arthurian Lot or Loth was Lud or Ludd. His name
lingers in "Lothian".</p>

<p>Gwydion, the son of Don, was a prominent British
deity and has been compared to Odin. He was the
father of the god Lleu, whose mother was Arianrod.
The rainbow was "Lleu's rod-sling". Dwynwen, the
so-called British Venus, was Christianized as "the
blessed Dwyn" and the patron saint of the church of
Llanddwyn in Anglesey. The magic cauldron was
possessed by the Welsh goddess Kerridwen.</p>

<p>A prominent god whose worship appears to have
been widespread was connected with the apple tree,
which in the Underworld and Islands of the Blest
was the "Tree of Life". Ancient beliefs and ceremonies
connected with the apple cult survive in those
districts in southern England where the curious custom
is observed of "wassailing" the apple trees on Christmas
Eve or Twelfth Night.<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> The "wassailers" visit
the tree and sing a song in which each apple is
asked to bear</p>

<div class="line">Sack-fulls, pocket-fulls.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Cider is poured about the roots of apple trees. This
ceremony appears to have been originally an elaborate
one. The tom-tit or some other small bird was connected
with the apple tree, as was the robin or wren
of other cults with the oak tree. At the wassailing
ceremony a boy climbed up into a tree and impersonated
the bird. It may be that in Pagan times a boy was
sacrificed to the god of the tree. That the bird (in
some cases it was the robin red-breast) was hunted
and sacrificed is indicated by old English folk-songs
beginning like the following:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
Old Robin is dead and gone to his grave,</div>
<div class="line i1">  Hum! Ha! gone to his grave;</div>
<div class="line">They planted an apple tree over his head,</div>
<div class="line i1">  Hum! Ha! over his head.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland a deity,
or a group of deities in the Underworld, was associated
with a magic cauldron, or as it is called in
Gaelic a "pot of plenty". Heroes or gods obtain
possession of this cauldron, which provides an inexhaustible
food supply and much treasure, or is used
for purposes of divination. It appears to have been
Christianized into the "Holy Grail", to obtain possession
of which Arthurian knights set out on perilous
journeys.</p>

<p>Originally the pot was a symbol of the mother goddess,
who renewed youth, provided food for all, and was
the source of treasure, luck, victory, and wisdom. This
goddess was associated with the mother cow and the
life-prolonging pearls that were searched for by early
Eastern prospectors. There are references to cows and
pearls in Welsh and Gaelic poems and legends regarding
the pot. An old Welsh poem in the <cite>Book of Taliesin</cite>
says of the cauldron:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">By the breath of nine maidens it would be kindled.</div>
<div class="line">The head of Hades' cauldron&mdash;what is it like?</div>
<div class="line">A rim it has, with pearls round its border:</div>
<div class="line">It boils not coward's food: it would not be perjured.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This extract is from the poem known as "Preidden
Annwfn" ("Harryings of Hades"), translated by the late
Professor Sir John Rhys. Arthur and his heroes visit
Hades to obtain the cauldron, and reference is made to
the "Speckled Ox". Arthur, in another story, obtains
the cauldron from Ireland. It is full of money. The
Welsh god Bran gives to a king of Ireland a magic
cauldron which restores to life those dead men who are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
placed in it. A Gaelic narrative relates the story of
Cuchullin's harrying of Hades, which is called "Dun
Scaith". Cuchullin's assailants issue from a pit in the
centre of Dun Scaith in forms of serpents, toads, and
sharp-beaked monsters. He wins the victory and carries
away three magic cows and a cauldron that gives inexhaustible
supplies of food, gold, and silver.</p>

<p>The pot figures in various mythologies. It was a
symbol of the mother goddess Hathor of ancient Egypt
and of the mother goddess of Troy, and it figures in
Indian religious literature. In Gaelic lore the knife
which cuts inexhaustible supplies of flesh from a dry
bone is evidently another symbol of the deity.</p>

<p>The talismans possessed by the Dananns were the
cauldron, the sword and spear of Lugh, and the Lia
Fail (or Stone of Destiny)<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>, which reminds one of the
three Japanese symbols, the solar mirror, the dragon
sword, and the tama (a pearl or round stone) kept in
a Shinto shrine at Ise. The goddess's "life substance"
was likewise in fruits like the Celestial apples, nuts,
rowan berries, &amp;c., of the Celts, and the grapes, pomegranates,
&amp;c., of other peoples, and in herbs like the
mugwort and mandrake. Her animals were associated
with rivers. The name of the River Boyne signifies
"white cow". Tarf (bull) appears in several river
names, as also does the goddess name Deva (Devona)
in the Devon, Dee, &amp;c. Philologists have shown that
Ness, the Inverness-shire river, is identical with Nestos
in Thrace and Neda in Greece. The goddess Belisama
(the goddess of war) was identified with the Mersey.</p>

<p>Goddess groups, usually triads, were as common in
Gaul as they were in ancient Crete. These deities were
sometimes called the "Mothers", as in Marne, the
famous French river, and in the Welsh <i lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">Y Mamau</i>, one
of the names of the "fairies".</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
Other names of goddess groups include Proximæ
(kinswoman), Niskai (water spirits), and Dervonnæ (oak
spirits). The Romans took over these and other groups
of ancient deities and the beliefs about their origin in
the mythical sea they were supposed to cross or rise
from. Gaelic references to "the coracle of the fairy
woman" or "supernatural woman" are of special interest
in this connection, especially when it is found that
the "coracle" is a sea-shell which, by the way, figures as
a canopy symbol in some of the sculptured groups of
Romano-British grouped goddesses who sometimes bear
baskets of apples, sheafs of grain, &amp;c. When the shell
provides inexhaustible supplies of curative or knowledge-conferring
milk, it links with the symbolic pot.</p>

<p>Most of the ancient deities had local names, and consequently
a number of Gaulish gods were identified by
the Romans with Apollo, including Borvo, whose name
lingers in Bourbon, Grannos of Aquæ Granni (Aix la
Chapelle), Mogounus, whose name has been shortened to
Mainz, &amp;c. The gods Taranucus (thunderer), Uxell&#301;mus
(the highest), &amp;c., were identified with Jupiter; Dunatis
(fort god), Albiorix (world king), Caturix (battle king),
Belatucadros (brilliant in war), Cocidius, &amp;c., were
identified with Mars. The name of the god Cam&#365;los
clings to Colchester (Camulodunun). There are
Romano-British inscriptions that refer to the ancient
gods under various Celtic names. A popular deity was
the god of Silvanus, who conferred health and was, no
doubt, identified with a tree or herb.</p>

<p>It is uncertain at what period beliefs connected with
stars were introduced into the British Isles.<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> As we have
seen, the Welsh deities were connected with certain star
groups. "Three Celtic goddesses", writes Anwyl,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
referring to Gaul, "whose worship attained to highest
development were Damona (the goddess of cattle), Sirona
(the aged one or the star goddess), and Ep&#335;na (the goddess
of horses). These names are Indo-European."
An Irish poem by a bard who is supposed to have lived
in the ninth century refers to the Christian saint Ciaran
of Saigir as a man of stellar origin:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Liadaine (his mother) was asleep</div>
<div class="line">On her bed.</div>
<div class="line">When she turned her face to heaven</div>
<div class="line">A star fell into her mouth.</div>
<div class="line">Thence was born the marvellous child</div>
<div class="line">Ciaran of Saigir who is proclaimed to thee.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the north and north-west Highlands the aurora
borealis is called <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Na Fir Chlis</i> ("the nimble men") and
"the merry dancers". They are regarded as fairies
(supernatural beings) like the sea "fairies" <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Na Fir Ghorm</i>
("blue men"), who were probably sea gods.</p>

<p>The religious beliefs of the Romans were on no
higher a level than those of the ancient Britons and
Gaels.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<small>Historical Summary</small></h2>

<p>The evidence dealt with in the foregoing chapters
throws considerable light on the history of early man
in Britain. We really know more about pre-Roman
times than about that obscure period of Anglo-Saxon
invasion and settlement which followed on the withdrawal
of the Roman army of occupation, yet historians,
as a rule, regard it as "pre-historic" and outside their
sphere of interest. As there are no inscriptions and no
documents to render articulate the archæological Ages
of Stone and Bronze, they find it impossible to draw any
definite conclusions.</p>

<p>It can be urged, however, in criticism of this attitude,
that the relics of the so-called "pre-historic age" may be
found to be even more reliable than some contemporary
documents of the "historic" period. Not a few of these
are obviously biassed and prejudiced, while some are so
vague and fragmentary that the conclusions drawn from
them cannot be otherwise than hypothetical in character.
A plainer, clearer, and more reliable story is revealed
by the bones and the artifacts and the surviving relics
of the intellectual life of our remote ancestors than by
the writings of some early chroniclers and some early
historians. It is possible, for instance, in consequence
of the scanty evidence available, to hold widely diverging
views regarding the Anglo-Saxon and Celtic problems.
Pro-Teutonic and pro-Celtic protagonists involve
us invariably in bitter controversy. That contemporary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
documentary evidence, even when somewhat voluminous,
may fail to yield a clear record of facts is evident from
the literature that deals, for instance, with the part
played by Mary Queen of Scots in the Darnley conspiracy
and in the events that led to her execution.</p>

<p>The term "pre-historic" is one that should be discarded.
It is possible, as has been shown, to write, although in
outline, the history of certain ancient race movements,
of the growth and decay of the civilization revealed by
the cavern art of Aurignacian and Magdalenian times,
of early trade and of early shipping. The history of art
goes back for thousands of years before the Classic Age
dawned in Greece; the history of trade can be traced to
that remote period when Red Sea shells were imported
into Italy by Crô-Magnon man; and the history of British
shipping can be shown to be as old as those dug-outs
that foundered in ancient Scottish river beds before the
last land movement had ceased.</p>

<p>The history of man really begins when and where we
find the first clear traces of his activities, and as it is possible
to write not only regarding the movements of the
Crô-Magnon races, but of their beliefs as revealed by
burial customs, their use of body paint, the importance
attached to shell and other talismans, and their wonderful
and high attainments in the arts and crafts, the European
historical period can be said to begin in the post-Glacial
epoch when tundra conditions prevailed in Central and
Western Europe and Italy was connected with the North
African coast.</p>

<p>In the case of ancient Egypt, historical data have
been gleaned from archæological remains as well as
from religious texts and brief records of historical events.
The history of Egyptian agriculture has been traced
back beyond the dawn of the Dynastic Age and to that
inarticulate period before the hieroglyphic system of writing
had been invented, by the discovery in the stomachs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
of the bodies of proto-Egyptians, naturally preserved in
hot dry sands, of husks of barley and of millet native to
the land of Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>The historical data so industriously accumulated in
Egypt and Babylonia have enabled excavators to date
certain finds in Crete, and to frame a chronological
system for the ancient civilization of that island. Other
relics afford proof of cultural contact between Crete and
the mainland, as far westward as Spain, where traces of
Cretan activities have been discovered. With the aid
of comparative evidence, much light is thrown, too, on
the history of the ancient Hittites, who have left inscriptions
that have not yet been deciphered. The
discoveries made by Siret in Spain and Portugal of
unmistakable evidence of Egyptian and Babylonian
cultural influence, trade, and colonization are, therefore,
to be welcomed. The comparative evidence in this connection
provides a more reliable basis than has hitherto
been available for Western European archæology. It
is possible for the historian to date approximately the
beginning of the export trade in jet from England&mdash;apparently
from Whitby in Yorkshire&mdash;and of the export
trade in amber from the Baltic, and the opening of the
sea routes between Spain and Northern Europe. The
further discovery of Egyptian beads in south-western
England, in association with relics of the English
"Bronze Age", is of far-reaching importance. A "prehistoric"
period surely ceases to be "prehistoric" when
its relics can be dated even approximately. The English
jet found in Spain takes us back till about 2500 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
and the Egyptian beads found in England till about
1300 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></p>

<p>The dating of these and other relics raises the question
whether historians should accept, without qualification,
or at all, the system of "Ages" adopted by archæologists.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
Terms like "Palæolithic" (Old Stone) and "Neolithic"
(New Stone) are, in most areas, without precise
chronological significance. As applied in the historical
sense, they tend to obscure the fact that the former applies
to a most prolonged period during which more than one
civilization arose, flourished, and decayed. In the so-called
"Old Stone Age" flint was worked with a degree
of skill never surpassed in the "New Stone Age", as
Aurignacian and Solutrean artifacts testify; it was also
sometimes badly worked from poorly selected material,
as in Magdalenian times, when bone and horn were
utilized to such an extent that archæologists would be
justified in referring to a "Bone and Horn Age".</p>

<p>Before the Neolithic industry was introduced into
Western Europe and the so-called "Neolithic Age"
dawned, as it ended, at various periods in various areas,
great climatic changes took place, and the distribution
of sea and land changed more than once. Withal,
considerable race movements took place in Central and
Western Europe. In time new habits of life were introduced
into our native land that influenced more profoundly
the subsequent history of Britain than could
have been possibly accomplished by a new method of
working flint. The most important cultural change was
effected by the introduction of the agricultural mode of
life.</p>

<p>It is important to bear in mind in this connection that
the ancient civilizations of Egypt and Babylonia were
based on the agricultural mode of life, and that when
this mode of life passed into Europe a complex culture
was transported with it from the area of origin. It was
the early agriculturists who developed shipbuilding and
the art of navigation, who first worked metals, and set
a religious value on gold and silver, on pearls, and on
certain precious stones, and sent out prospectors to
search for precious metals and precious gems in distant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
lands. The importance of agriculture in the history of
civilization cannot be overestimated. In so far as our
native land is concerned, a new epoch was inaugurated
when the first agriculturist tilled the soil, sowed imported
barley seeds, using imported implements, and practising
strange ceremonies at sowing, and ultimately at harvest
time, that had origin in a far-distant "cradle" of civilization,
and still linger in our midst as folk-lore evidence,
testifies to the full. In ancient times the ceremonies
were regarded as being of as much importance as the
implements, and the associated myths were connected
with the agriculturists' Calendar, as the Scottish Gaelic
Calendar bears testimony.</p>

<p>Instead, therefore, of dividing the early history of
man in Britain into periods, named after the materials
from which he made implements and weapons, these
should be divided so as to throw light on habits of
life and habits of thought. The early stages of civilization
can be referred to as the "Pre-Agricultural", and
those that follow as the "Early Agricultural".</p>

<p>Under "Pre-Agricultural" come the culture stages,
or rather the industries known as (1) Aurignacian, (2)
Solutrean, and (3) Magdalenian. These do not have
the same chronological significance everywhere in
Europe, for the Solutrean industry never disturbed or
supplemented the Aurignacian in Italy or in Spain south
of the Cantabrian Mountains, nor did Aurignacian penetrate
into Hungary, where the first stage of Modern Man's
activities was the Solutrean. The three stages, however,
existed during the post-Glacial period, when man hunted
the reindeer and other animals favouring similar climatic
conditions. The French archæologists have named this
the "Reindeer Age". Three later industries were introduced
into Europe during the Pre-Agricultural Age.
These are known as (1) Azilian, (2) Tardenoisian, and
(3) Maglemosian. The ice-cap was retreating, the reindeer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
and other tundra animals moved northward, and
the red deer arrived in Central and Western Europe.
We can, therefore, refer to the latter part of the Pre-Agricultural
times as the "Early Red Deer Age".</p>

<p>There is Continental evidence to show that the Neolithic
industry was practised prior to the introduction of
the agricultural mode of life. The "Early Agricultural
Age", therefore, cuts into the archæological "Neolithic
Age" in France. Whether or not it does so in Britain
is uncertain.</p>

<p>At the dawn of the British "Early Agricultural Age"
cultural influences were beginning to "flow" from
centres of ancient civilization, if not directly, at any rate
indirectly. As has been indicated in the foregoing
pages, the Neolithic industry was practised in Britain by
a people who had a distinct social organization and
engaged in trade. Some Neolithic flints were of Eastern
type or origin. The introduction of bronze from the
Continent appears to have been effected by seafaring
traders, and there is no evidence that it changed the
prevailing habits of thought and life. Our ancestors
did not change their skins and their ideas when they
began to use and manufacture bronze. A section of
them adopted a new industry, but before doing so they
had engaged in the search for gold. This is shown by
the fact that they settled on the granite in Devon and
Cornwall, while yet they were using flints of Neolithic
form which had been made elsewhere. Iron working
was ultimately introduced. The Bronze and Iron
"Ages" of the archæologists can be included in the
historian's "Early Agricultural Age", because agriculture
continued to be the most important factor in the
economic life of Britain. It was the basis of its civilization;
it rendered possible the development of mining
and of various industries, and the promotion of trade
by land and sea. In time the Celtic peoples&mdash;that is,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
peoples who spoke Celtic dialects&mdash;arrived in Britain.
The Celtic movement was in progress at 500 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and
had not ended after Julius Cæsar invaded southern England.
It was finally arrested by the Roman occupation,
but continued in Ireland. When it really commenced is
uncertain; the earliest Celts may have used bronze only.</p>

<p>The various Ages, according to the system suggested,
are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <b>The Pre-Agricultural Age.</b></p>

<p class="hanging">Sub-divisions: (A) the <i>Reindeer Age</i> with the Aurignacian,
Solutrean, and Magdalenian industries;
(B) the <i>Early Red Deer Age</i> with the Azilian,
Tardenoisian, and Maglemosian industries.</p>

<p>2. <b>The Early Agricultural Age.</b></p>

<p class="hanging">Sub-divisions: (A) the <i>Pre-Celtic Age</i> with the Neolithic,
copper and bronze industries; (B) the <i>Celtic
Age</i> with the bronze, iron, and enamel industries.</p>

<p>3. <b>The Romano-British Age.</b></p>

<p class="hanging">Including in Scotland (A) the <i>Caledonian Age</i> and
(B) the <i>Early Scoto-Pictish Age</i>; and in Ireland the
<i>Cuchullin Age</i>, during which bronze and iron were
used.</p>

<p>The view favoured by some historians that our ancestors
were, prior to the Roman invasion, mere "savages"
can no longer obtain. It is clearly without justification.
Nor are we justified in perpetuating the equally hazardous
theory that early British culture was of indigenous
origin, and passed through a series of evolutionary
stages in isolation until the country offered sufficient
attractions to induce first the Celts and afterwards the
Romans to conquer it. The correct and historical view
appears to be that from the earliest times Britain was
subjected to racial and cultural "drifts" from the Continent,
and that the latter outnumbered the former.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
In the Pre-Agricultural Age Crô-Magnon colonists
reached England and Wales while yet in the Aurignacian
stage of civilization. As much is indicated by the
evidence of the Paviland cave in South Wales. At a
later period, proto-Solutrean influence, which had
entered Western Europe from North Africa, filtered into
England, and can be traced in those caverns that have
yielded evidence of occupation. The pure Solutrean
culture subsequently swept from Eastern Europe as far
westward as Northern Spain, but Britain, like Southern
Spain and Italy, remained immune to it. Magdalenian
culture then arose and became widespread. It had
relations with the earlier Aurignacian and owed nothing
to Solutrean. England yields undoubted traces of its
influence, which operated vigorously at a time when
Scotland was yet largely covered with ice. Certain
elements in Aurignacian and Magdalenian cultures
appear to have persisted in our midst until comparatively
recent times, especially in connection with burial customs
and myths regarding the "sleeping heroes" in burial
caverns.</p>

<p>The so-called "Transition Period" between the Upper
Palæolithic and Neolithic Ages is well represented,
especially in Scotland, where the land rose after early
man's arrival, and even after the introduction of shipping.
As England was sinking when Scotland was rising,
English traces of the period are difficult to find. This
"Transition Period" was of greater duration than the
archæological "Neolithic Age".</p>

<p>Of special interest is the light thrown by relics of the
"Transition Period" on the race problem. Apparently
the Crô-Magnons and other peoples of the Magdalenian
Age were settled in Britain when the intruders, who had
broken up Magdalenian civilization on the Continent,
began to arrive. These were (1) the Azilians of Iberian
(Mediterranean) type; (2) the Tardenoisians, who came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
through Italy from North Africa, and were likewise, it
would appear, of Mediterranean racial type; and (3) the
Maglemosians, who were mainly a fair, tall people of
Northern type. The close proximity of Azilian and
Maglemosian stations in western Scotland&mdash;at the MacArthur
cave (Azilian) and the Drumvaragie shelter
(Maglemosian) at Oban, for instance&mdash;suggests that in
the course of time racial intermixture took place. That
all the fair peoples of England, Scotland, and Ireland
are descended from Celts or Norwegians is a theory
which has not taken into account the presence in these
islands at an early period, and before the introduction
of the Neolithic industry, of the carriers from the Baltic
area of Maglemosian culture.</p>

<p>We next pass to the so-called Neolithic stage of
culture,<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> and find it affords fuller and more definite
evidence regarding the early history of our native land.
As has been shown, there are data which indicate that
there was no haphazard distribution of the population
of England when the Neolithic industry and the agricultural
mode of life were introduced. The theory must
be discarded that "Neolithic man" was a wanderer,
whose movements depended entirely on those of the
wild animals he hunted, as well as the further theory
that stone implements and weapons were not used after
the introduction of metals. There were, as can be
gathered from the evidence afforded by archæological
remains, settled village communities, and centres of industry
in the Age referred to by archæologists as "Neolithic".
The Early Agricultural Age had dawned.
Sections of the population engaged in agriculture, sections
were miners and workers of flint, sections were
hunters and fishermen, sections searched for gold, pigments
for body paint, material for ornaments of religious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
value, &amp;c., and sections engaged in trade, not only with
English and Scottish peoples, but with those of the
Continent. The English Channel, and probably the
North Sea, were crossed by hardy mariners who engaged
in trade.</p>

<p>At an early period in the Early Agricultural Age and
before bronze working was introduced, England and
Wales, Scotland and Ireland, were influenced more
directly than had hitherto been the case by the high
civilizations of Egypt and Mesopotamia, and especially
by their colonies in South-western Europe. The recent
Spanish finds indicate that a great "wave" of high
Oriental culture was in motion in Spain as far back as
2500 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and perhaps at an even earlier period. Included
among Babylonian and Egyptian relics in Spain
are, as has been stated, jet from Whitby, Yorkshire,
and amber from the Baltic. Apparently the colonists
had trading relations with Britain. Whether the "Tin
Land", which was occupied by a people owing allegiance
to Sargon of Akkad, was ancient Britain is quite uncertain.
It was more probably some part of Western
Europe. That Western European influence was reaching
Britain before the last land movement had ceased is
made evident by the fact that the ancient boat with a
cork plug, which was found in Clyde silt at Glasgow,
lay 25 feet above the present sea-level. The cork plug
undoubtedly came from Spain or Italy, and the boat is
of Mediterranean type.<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> It is evident that long before
the introduction of bronze working the coasts of Britain
were being explored by enterprizing prospectors, and that
the virgin riches of our native land were being exploited.
In this connection it is of importance to find that the
earliest metal artifacts introduced into our native islands
were brought by traders, and that those that reached
England were mainly of Gaulish type, while those that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
reached Ireland were Spanish. The Neolithic industry
does not appear to have been widespread in Ireland,
where copper artifacts were in use at a very early period.</p>

<p>A large battle-axe of pure copper, described by Sir
David Brewster in 1822 (<cite>Edinburgh Philosophical
Journal</cite>, Vol. VI, p. 357), was found at a depth of 20
feet in Ratho Bog, near Edinburgh. Above it were
9 feet of moss, 7 feet of sand, and 4 feet of hard black
till-clay. "It must have been deposited along with the
blue clay", wrote Brewster, "prior to the formation of
the superincumbent stratum of sand, and must have
existed before the diluvial operations by which that
stratum was formed. This opinion of its antiquity is
strongly confirmed by the peculiarity of its shape, and
the nature of its composition." The Spanish discoveries
have revived interest in this important find.</p>

<p>As has been indicated, jet, pearls, gold, and tin appear
to have been searched for and found before bronze
working became a British industry. That the early
prospectors had experience in locating and working
metals before they reached this country there can be
little doubt. There was a psychological motive for their
adventurous voyages to unknown lands. The distribution
of the megalithic monuments and graves indicates
that metals were found and worked in south-western
England, in Wales, in Derbyshire, and Cumberland,
that jet was worked at Whitby, and that metals were
located in Ireland and Scotland. Gold must have been
widely distributed during the period of the great thaw.
It is unlikely that traces of alluvial gold, which had
been located and well worked in ancient times, should
remain until the present time. In Scotland no traces
of gold can now be found in a number of districts where,
according to the records, it was worked as late as the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Some of the surviving
Scottish megalithic monuments may mark the sites of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
ancient goldfields that were abandoned in early times
when the supplies of precious metal became exhausted.
The great circles of Callernish in Lewis and Stennis in
Orkney are records of activity in semi-barren areas.
Large communities could not have been attracted to
these outlying islands to live on the produce of land or
sea. Traces of metals, &amp;c., indicate that, in both areas
in ancient times, the builders of megalithic monuments
settled in remote areas in Britain for the same reason as
they settled on parts of the Continent. A gold rod has
been discovered in association with the "Druid Temple"
at Leys, near Inverness. The Inverness group of circles
may well have been those of gold-seekers. In Aberdeenshire
a group of megalithic monuments appears to
have been erected by searchers for pearls. Gold was
found in this county in the time of the Stuart kings.</p>

<p>The close association of megalithic monuments with
ancient mine workings makes it impossible to resist
the conclusion that the worship of trees and wells was
closely connected with the religion of which the megalithic
monuments are records. Siret shows that the
symbolic markings on typical stone monuments are
identical with those of the tree cult. Folk-lore and
philological data tend to support this view. From the
root <i>nem</i> are derived the Celtic names of the pearl,
heaven, the grove, and the shrine within the grove
(see <a href="#Page_157">Chap. XIII</a>). The Celts appear to have embraced
the Druidic system of the earlier Iberians in Western
Europe, whose culture had been derived from that of
the Oriental colonists.</p>

<p>The Oriental mother goddess was connected with
the sacred tree, with gold and gems, with pearls,
with rivers, lakes, and the sea, with the sky and
with the heavenly bodies, long centuries before the
Palm-tree cult was introduced into Spain by Oriental
colonists. The symbolism of pearls links with that of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
jet, the symbolism of jet with that of Baltic amber,
and the symbolism of Baltic amber with that of Adriatic
amber and of Mediterranean coral. All these sacred
things were supposed to contain, like jasper and turquoise
in Egypt, the "life substance" of the mother goddess
who had her origin in water and her dwelling in
a tree, and was connected with the sky and "the waters
above the firmament". Coral was supposed to be her
sea tree, and jet, amber, silver, and gold were supposed
to grow from her fertilizing tears. Beliefs about "grown
gold" were quite rife in mediæval Britain.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>It should not surprise us, therefore, to find traces
of Oriental religious conceptions in ancient Britain and
Ireland. These have apparently passed from country
to country, from people to people, from language to
language, and down the Ages without suffering great
change. Even when mixed with ideas imported from
other areas, they have preserved their original fundamental
significance. The Hebridean "maiden-queen"
goddess, who dwells in a tree and provides milk from
a sea-shell, has a history rooted in a distant area of
origin, where the goddess who personified the life-giving
shell was connected with the cow and the sky
(the Milky Way), as was the goddess Hathor, the
Egyptian Aphrodite. The tendency to locate imported
religious beliefs no doubt provides the reason why the
original palm tree of the goddess was replaced in
Britain by the hazel, the elm, the rowan, the apple tree,
the oak, &amp;c.</p>

<p>On the Continent there were displacements of peoples
after the introduction of bronze, and especially of bronze
weapons. There was wealth and there was trade to
attract and reward the conqueror. The Eastern
traders of Spain were displaced. Some appear to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
migrated into Gaul and North Italy; others may have
found refuge in Ireland and Britain. The sea-routes
were not, however, closed. Ægean culture filtered into
Western Europe from Crete, and through the Hallstatt
culture centre from the Danubian area. The culture
of the tribes who spoke Celtic dialects was veined with
Ægean and Asiatic influences. In time Continental
Druidism imbibed ideas regarding the Transmigration
of Souls and the custom of cremation from an area in
the East which had influenced the Aryan invaders of
India.</p>

<p>The origin of the Celts is obscure. Greek writers
refer to them as a tall, fair people. They were evidently
a branch of the fair Northern race, but whether they
came from Northern Europe or Northern Asia is uncertain.
In Western Europe they intruded themselves
as conquerors and formed military aristocracies. Like
other vigorous, intruding minorities elsewhere and at
different periods, they were in certain localities absorbed
by the conquered. In Western Europe they were
fused with Iberian communities, and confederacies of
Celtiberians came into existence.</p>

<p>Before the great Celtic movements into Western Europe
began&mdash;that is, before 500 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>&mdash;Britain was invaded
by a broad-headed people, but it is uncertain whether
they came as conquerors or as peaceful traders. In
time these intruders were absorbed. The evidence
afforded by burial customs and surviving traces of
ancient religious beliefs and practices tends to show
that the culture of the earlier peoples survived over
large tracts of our native land. An intellectual conquest
of conquerors or intruders was effected by the
indigenous population which was rooted to the soil
by agriculture and to centres of industry and trade
by undisturbed habits of life.</p>

<p>Although the pre-Celtic languages were ultimately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
displaced by the Celtic&mdash;it is uncertain when this process
was completed&mdash;the influence of ancient Oriental culture
remained. In Scotland the pig-taboo, with its history
rooted in ancient Egypt, has had tardy survival until
our own times. It has no connection with Celtic
culture, for the Continental Celts were a pig-rearing
and pork-eating people, like the Ægæan invaders of
Greece. The pig-taboo is still as prevalent in Northern
Arcadia as in the Scottish Highlands, where the descendants
not only of the ancient Iberians but of
intruders from pork-loving Ireland and Scandinavia
have acquired the ancient prejudice and are now perpetuating
it.</p>

<p>Some centuries before the Roman occupation, a
system of gold coinage was established in England.
Trade with the Continent appears to have greatly increased
in volume and complexity. England, Wales,
Scotland, and Ireland were divided into small kingdoms.
The evidence afforded by the Irish Gaelic
manuscripts, which refer to events before and after the
Roman conquest of Britain, shows that society was
well organized and that the organization was of non-Roman
character. Tacitus is responsible for the statement
that the Irish manners and customs were similar
to those prevailing in Britain, and he makes reference
to Irish sea-trade and the fact that Irish sea-ports were
well known to merchants. England suffered more from
invasions before and after the arrival of Julius Cæsar
than did Scotland or Ireland. It was consequently
incapable of united action against the Romans, as
Tacitus states clearly. The indigenous tribes refused
to be allies of the intruders.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>In Ireland, which Pliny referred to as one of the
British Isles, the pre-Celtic Firbolgs were subdued by
Celtic invaders. The later "waves" of Celts appeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
to have subdued the earlier conquerors, with the result
that "Firbolg" ceased to have a racial significance
and was applied to all subject peoples. There were
in Ireland, as in England, upper and lower classes,
and military tribes that dominated other tribes. Withal,
there were confederacies, and petty kings, who owed
allegiance to "high kings". The "Red Branch" of
Ulster, of which Cuchullin was an outstanding representative,
had their warriors trained in Scotland.
It may be that they were invaders who had passed
through Scotland into Northern Ireland; at any rate,
it is unlikely that they would have sent their warriors
to a "colony" to acquire skill in the use of weapons.
There were Cruithne (Britons) in all the Irish provinces.
Most Irish saints were of this stock.</p>

<p>The pre-Roman Britons had ships of superior quality,
as is made evident by the fact that a British squadron
was included in the great Veneti fleet which Cæsar
attacked and defeated with the aid of Pictones and
other hereditary rivals of the Veneti and their allies.
In early Roman times Britain thus took an active part
in European politics in consequence of its important
commercial interests.</p>

<p>When the Romans reached Scotland the Caledonians,
a people with a Celtic tribal name, were politically
predominant. Like the English and Irish pre-Roman
peoples, they used chariots and ornamented these with
finely worked bronze. Enamel was manufactured or
imported. Some of the Roman stories about the savage
condition of Scotland may be dismissed as fictions.
Who can nowadays credit the statement of Herodian<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
that the warriors of Scotland in Roman times passed
their days in the water, or Dion Cassius's<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> story that
they were wont to hide in mud for several days with
nothing but their heads showing, and that despite their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
fine physique they fed chiefly on herbs, fruit, nuts,
and the bark of trees, and, withal, that they had discovered
a mysterious earth-nut and had only to eat
a piece no larger than a bean to defy hunger and
thirst. The further statement that the Scottish "savages"
were without state or family organization hardly
accords with historical facts. Even Agricola had cause
to feel alarm when confronted by the well-organized
and well-equipped Caledonian army at the battle of
Mons Grampius, and he found it necessary to retreat
afterwards, although he claimed to have won a complete
victory. His retreat appears to have been as
necessary as that of Napoleon from Moscow. The
later invasion of the Emperor Severus was a disastrous
one for him, entailing the loss of 50,000 men.</p>

<p>A people who used chariots and horses, and artifacts
displaying the artistic skill of those found in
ancient Britain, had reached a comparatively high state
of civilization. Warriors did not manufacture their
own chariots, the harness of their horses, their own
weapons, armour, and ornaments; these were provided
for them by artisans. Such things as they required
and could not obtain in their own country had to be
imported by traders. The artisans had to be paid in
kind, if not in coin, and the traders had to give something
in return for what they received. Craftsmen
and traders had to be protected by laws, and the laws
had to be enforced.</p>

<p>The evidence accumulated by archæologists is sufficient
to prove that Britain had inherited from seats
of ancient civilization a high degree of culture and
technical skill in metal-working, &amp;c., many centuries
before Rome was built. The finest enamel work on
bronze in the world was produced in England and
Ireland, and probably, although definite proof has not
yet been forthcoming, in Scotland, the enamels of which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
may have been imported and may not. Artisans could
not have manufactured enamel without furnaces capable
of generating a high degree of heat. The process was
a laborious and costly one. It required technical knowledge
and skill on the part of the workers. Red, white,
yellow, and blue enamels were manufactured. Even the
Romans were astonished at the skill displayed in
enamel work by the Britons. The people who produced
these enamels and the local peoples who purchased
them, including the Caledonians, were far
removed from a state of savagery.</p>

<p>Many writers, who have accepted without question the
statements of certain Roman writers regarding the early
Britons and ignored the evidence that archæological
relics provide regarding the arts and crafts and social
conditions of pre-Roman times, have in the past written
in depreciatory vein regarding the ancestors of the vast
majority of the present population of these islands, who
suffered so severely at the altar of Roman ambition.
Everything Roman has been glorified; Roman victories
over British "barbarians" have been included among
the "blessings" of civilization. Yet "there is", as
Elton says, "something at once mean and tragical
about the story of the Roman conquest.... On the one
side stand the petty tribes, prosperous nations in minature,
already enriched by commerce and rising to a
homely culture; on the other the terrible Romans strong
in their tyranny and an avarice which could never be
appeased."<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>It was in no altruistic spirit that the Romans invaded
Gaul and broke up the Celtic organization, or that they
invaded Briton and reduced a free people to a state of
bondage. The life blood of young Britain was drained
by Rome, and, for the loss sustained, Roman institutions,
Roman villas and baths, and the Latin language and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
literature were far from being compensations. Rome
was a predatory state. When its military organization
collapsed, its subject states fell with it. Gaul and Britain
had been weakened by Roman rule; the ancient spirit of
independence had been undermined; native initiative
had been ruthlessly stamped out under a system more
thorough and severe than modern Prussianism. At the
same time, there is, of course, much to admire in Roman
civilization.</p>

<p>During the obscure post-Roman period England
was occupied by Angles and Saxons and Jutes, who
have been credited with the wholesale destruction of
masses of the Britons. The dark-haired survivors were
supposed to have fled westward, leaving the fair intruders
in undisputed occupation of the greater part of England.
But the indigenous peoples of the English mining areas
were originally a dark-haired and sallow people, and the
invading Celts were mainly a fair people. Boadicea
was fair-haired like Queen Maeve of Ireland. The
evidence collected of late years by ethnologists shows
that the masses of the English population are descended
from the early peoples of the Pre-Agricultural and Early
Agricultural Ages. The theory of the wholesale extermination
by the Anglo-Saxons of the early Britons has
been founded manifestly on very scant and doubtful
evidence.</p>

<p>What the Teutonic invasions accomplished in reality
was the destruction not of a people but of a civilization.
The native arts and crafts declined, and learning was
stamped out, when the social organization of post-Roman
Britain was shattered. On the Continent a similar state
of matters prevailed. Roman civilization suffered decline
when the Roman soldier vanished.</p>

<p>Happily, the elements of "Celtic" civilization had
been preserved in those areas that had escaped the
blight of Roman ambition. The peoples of Celtic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
speech had preserved, as ancient Gaelic manuscripts
testify, a love of the arts as ardent as that of Rome,
and a fine code of chivalry to which the Romans were
strangers. The introduction of Christianity had advanced
this ancient Celtic civilization on new and higher lines.
When the Columban missionaries began their labours
outside Scotland and Ireland, they carried Christianity
and "a new humanism" over England and the Continent,
"and became the teachers of whole nations, the
counsellors of kings and emperors". Ireland and
Scotland had originally received their Christianity from
Romanized England and Gaul. The Celtic Church
developed on national lines. Vernacular literature was
promoted by the Celtic clerics.</p>

<p>In England, as a result of Teutonic intrusions and
conquests, Christianity and Romano-British culture had
been suppressed. The Anglo-Saxons were pagans. In
time the Celtic missionaries from Scotland and Ireland
spread Christianity and Christian culture throughout
England.</p>

<p>It is necessary for us to rid our minds of extreme pro-Teutonic
prejudices. Nor is it less necessary to avoid
the equally dangerous pitfall of the Celtic hypothesis.
Christianity and the associated humanistic culture
entered these islands during the Roman period. In
Ireland and Scotland the new religion was perpetuated
by communities that had preserved pre-Roman habits
of life and thought which were not necessarily of Celtic
origin or embraced by a people who can be accurately
referred to as the "Celtic race". The Celts did not
exterminate the earlier settlers. Probably the Celts
were military aristocrats over wide areas.</p>

<p>Before the fair Celts had intruded themselves in
Britain and Ireland, the seeds of pre-Celtic culture,
derived by trade and colonization from centres of ancient
civilization through their colonies, had been sown and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
had borne fruit. The history of British civilization
begins with neither Celt nor Roman, but with those
early prospectors and traders who entered and settled
in the British Isles when mighty Pharaohs were still
reigning in Egypt, and these and the enterprising
monarchs in Mesopotamia were promoting trade and
extending their spheres of influence. The North Syrian
or Anatolian carriers of Eastern civilization who founded
colonies in Spain before 2500 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> were followed by
Cretans and Ph&oelig;nicians. The sea-trade promoted by
these pioneers made possible the opening up of overland
trade routes. It was after Pytheas had (about 300 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>)
visited Britain by coasting round Spain and Northern
France from Marseilles that the volume of British trade
across France increased greatly and the sea-routes
became of less importance. When Carthage fell, the
Romans had the trade of Western Europe at their
mercy, and their conquests of Gaul and Britain were
undoubtedly effected for the purpose of enriching themselves
at the expense of subject peoples. We owe much
to Roman culture, but we owe much also to the culture
of the British pre-Roman period.</p>

Mr. Wilfrid Jackson, author of <cite>Shells as Evidence of the
Migrations of Early Culture</cite>, tells me that the "blue-eyed
limpet" is our common limpet&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Patella
vulgata</i>&mdash;the Lepas, Patelle, Jambe, &OElig;il de boue,
Bernicle, or Flie of the French. In Cornwall it is the "Crogan",
the "Bornigan", and the "Brennick". It is "flither" of the English,
"flia" of the Faroese, and "lapa" of the Portuguese. A Cornish giant
was once, according to a folk-tale, set to perform the hopeless
task of emptying a pool with a single limpet which had a hole in
it. Limpets are found in early British graves and in the "kitchen
middens". They are met with in abundance in cromlechs, on the Channel
Isles and in Brittany, covering the bones and the skulls of the dead.
Mr. Jackson thinks they were used like cowries for vitalizing and
protecting the dead.</p>

the Western Scottish harpoons, inclines to refer to the culture as
"Azilian-Tardenoisian". At the same time he considers the view that
Maglemosian influence was operating is worthy of consideration. He
notes that traces of Maglemosian culture have been reported from
England. The Abbé has detected Magdalenian influence in artifacts
from Campbeltown, Argyllshire (<cite>Proceedings of the Society of

<p><a name="Footnote_98" id="Footnote_98" href="#FNanchor_98" class="label">[98]</a> The fact that in the Scottish Lowlands the fairies were
sometimes called "Pechts" has been made much of by those who contend
that the prototypes of the fairies were the original inhabitants
of Western Europe. This theory ignores the well-established custom
of giving human names to supernatural beings. In Scotland the
hill-giants (Fomorians) have been re-named after Arthur (as in
Arthur's Seat, Edinburgh), Patrick (Inverness), Wallace (Eildon
Hills), Samson (Ben Ledi), &amp;c. In like manner fairies were
referred to as Pechts. The Irish evidence is of similar character.
The Danann deities were consigned to fairyland. Donald Gorm, a West
Highland chief, gave his name to an Irish fairy. Fairyland was the
old Paradise. Arthur, Thomas the Rhymer, Finn-mac-Coul, &amp;c.,
became "fairy-men" after death. A good deal of confusion has been
caused by mistranslating the Scottish Gaelic word <i lang="ga"
xml:lang="ga">sith</i> (Irish <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">sidhe</i>) as
"fairy". The word <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">sith</i> (pronounced
<i>shee</i>) means anything unearthly or supernatural, and the "peace" of
supernatural life&mdash;of death after life, as well as the silence
of the movements of supernatural beings. The cuckoo was supposed to
dwell for a part of the year in the underworld, and was called <i
lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">eun sith</i> ("supernatural bird"). Mysterious
epidemics were <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">sith</i> diseases. There were
<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">sith</i> (supernatural) dogs, cats, mice,
cows, &amp;c., as well as <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">sith</i> men and <i

interesting reference to amber. In the <cite>Proceedings of the
British Academy</cite>, Vol. II, p. 18, under "Celtic Inscriptions
of France and Italy", Sir John Rhys deals with Vebrumaros, a man's
name. The second element in this name is <i>m&#257;ros</i> (great); the
first, <i>uebru</i>, "is perhaps to be explained by reference to the
Welsh word <i>gwefr</i> (amber)". Rhys thought the name meant that the
man was distinguished for his display of amber "in the adornment of
his person". The name had probably a deeper significance. Amber was
closely associated with the mother goddess. One of her names may have
been "Uebru". She personified amber.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_190" id="Footnote_190" href="#FNanchor_190" class="label">[190]</a> The south-western Scottish pork trade dates only from the
latter part of the eighteenth century. There was trouble at Carlisle
custom house when the Lowland Scots began to export cured pork,
because of the difference between the English and Scottish salt duty.
"For some time", complained a Scottish writer on agriculture, in
June, 1811, "a duty of 2s. per hunderweight has been charged." Dublin
was exporting pork to London in the reign of Henry VIII. A small
trade in pork was conducted in eastern Scotland but was sporadic.</p>

he detested pork. The food prejudices of the common people thus
influenced royalty, although earlier kings and Norman nobles ate
pork, eels, &amp;c.</p>

"peace" and "silence" of supernatural beings. "Fairy", as Skeat has
emphasized, means "enchantment". It has taken the place of "fay",
which is derived from fate. The "fay" was a supernatural being.</p>

measured by the apparent movements of the stars. Cuchullin, while

observe the stars of the air, and ascertain when midnight comes".</p>
